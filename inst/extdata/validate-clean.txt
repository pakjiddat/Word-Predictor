pile the coal high in the shed corner
the gold vase is both rare and costly
the knife was hung inside its bright sheath
the rarest spice comes from the far east
the roof should be tilted at a sharp slant
a smatter of french is worse than none
the mule trod the treadmill day and night
the aim of the contest is to raise a great fund
to send it
now in large amounts is bad
there is a fine hard tang in salty air
cod is the main business of the north shore
the slab was hewn from heavy blocks of slate
dunk the stale biscuits into strong drink
hang tinsel from both branches
cap the jar with a tight brass cover
the poor boy missed the boat again
be sure to set the lamp firmly in the hole
pick a card and slip it
under the pack
a round mat will cover the dull spot
the first part of the plan needs changing
the good book informs of what we ought to know
the mail comes in three batches per day
you cannot brew tea in a cold
dots of light betrayed the black cat
put the chart on the mantel and tack it down
the night shift men rate extra pay
the red paper brightened the dim stage
see the player scoot to third base
slide the bill between the two leaves
many hands help get the job done
we like to admit our small faults
no doubt about the way the wind blows
dig deep in the earth for pirates gold
the steady drip is worse than a drenching rain
a flat pack takes less luggage space
green ice frosted the punch bowl
a stuffed chair slipped from the moving van
the stitch will serve but needs to be shortened
a thin book fits in the side pocket
the gloss on top made it unfit to read
the hail pattered on the burnt brown grass
seven seals were stamped on great sheets
our troops are set to strike heavy blows
the store was jammed before the sale could start
it was a bad error on the part of the new judge
one step more and the board will collapse
take the match and strike it against your shoe
the boiled but the contents failed to
the baby puts his right foot in his mouth
the bombs left most of the town in ruins
stop and stare at the hard working man
the streets are narrow and full of sharp turns
the pup the leash as he saw a feline shape
open your book to the first page
fish evade the net and swim off
dip the pail once and let it settle
will you please answer that phone
the big red apple fell to the ground
the curtain rose and the show was on
the young prince became heir to the throne
he sent the boy on a short errand
leave now and you will arrive on time
the corner store was robbed last night
a gold ring will please most any girl
the long journey home took a year
she saw a cat in the neighbors house
a pink shell was found on the sandy beach
small children came to see him
the grass and bushes were wet with dew
the blind man counted his old coins
a severe storm tore down the barn
she called his name many times
when you hear the bell come quickly
