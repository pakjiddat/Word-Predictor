the green light in the brown box
the brass tube circled the high wall
the lobes of her ears were pierced to hold rings
hold the hammer near the end to drive the nail
next sunday is the twelfth of the month
every word and phrase he speaks is true
he put his last cartridge into the gun and fired
they took their kids from the public school
drive the straight into the wood
keep the hatch tight and the watch constant
sever the twine with a quick snip of the knife
paper will dry out when wet
slide the catch back and open the desk
help the weak to preserve their strength
a sullen smile gets few friends
stop whistling and watch the boys march
the cord and out tumbles the gold
the tray across the glass top
the cloud moved in a stately way and was gone
light maple makes for a swell room
set the piece here and say nothing
dull stories make her laugh
a stiff cord will do to fasten your shoe
get the trust fund to the bank early
choose between the high road and the low
a plea for funds seems to come again
he lent his coat to the tall gaunt stranger
there is a strong chance it will happen once more
the duke left the park in a silver coach
greet the new guests and leave quickly
when the frost has come it is time for turkey
sweet words work better than fierce
a thin stripe runs down the middle
a six comes up more often than a ten
lush fern grow on the lofty rocks
the ram scared the school children off
the team with the best timing looks good
the farmer swapped his horse for a brown ox
sit on the perch and tell the others what to do
a steep trail is painful for our feet
the early phase of life moves fast
green moss grows on the northern side
tea in thin china has a sweet taste
pitch the straw through the door of the stable
the latch on the beck gate needed a nail
the goose was brought straight from the old market
the sink is the thing in which we pile dishes
a whiff of it will cure the most stubborn cold
the facts always show who is right
she her cape as she parades the street
the loss of the cruiser was a to the fleet
loop the braid to the left and then over
plead with the lawyer to drop the lost cause
calves thrive on tender spring grass
post no bills on this office wall
tear a thin sheet from the yellow pad
a cruise in warm waters in a sleek yacht is fun
a streak of color ran down the left edge
it was done before the boy could see it
crouch before you jump or miss the mark
pack the kits and forget the salt
the square peg will settle in the round hole
fine soap saves tender skin
eggs and tea must suffice
bad nerves are by a door slam
ship maps are different from those for planes
dimes showered down from all sides
they sang the same tunes at each party
the sky in the west is tinged with orange red
the pods of peas ferment in bare fields
the horse balked and threw the tall rider
the hitch between the horse and cart broke
pile the coal high in the shed corner
