There are days when I think we'd all be better off if we didn't exchange money, if we exchanged goods and services instead. Bartering is the way to go, I think, sometimes.

Kelburn's Cart Blanche was next. It's another local beer made just outside Glasgow. A small family micro-brewery turning out 30 barrels a week of consistent, well made tasty beer. It's fairly malty with a delicate and lovely hop balance. I've had it on better form but taking into account that it was being taken from the cask, decanted into jugs and then carried across the brewery to our tables it was still an enjoyable beer.

I just figured out that I've NEVER brewed a brown ale. Charlie Papazian's article and recipe for an American Brown Ale in the Mar/Apr edition of Zymurgy has inspired me. I think I'll brew my own version of this for my next "session beer" to have on tap. Session beer is defined by:
With time on my hands I have already updated my goals for 2009 list, which I will periodically profile as the New Year approaches and beyond. Writing about the lofty personal expectations will help keep me accountable. In 2008 I proved to myself that if I dream big and put my fears aside I am completely able to navigate through various self-imposed challenges and come out the other end in a much better state than I expected. I mean, that’s all easier said than done, right? I’m ready to do that again times 10 but in a way, I’m starting from scratch with no job at the moment and technically, the Hubs isn’t employed either. His new record doesn’t come out until the spring and who knows what will come of it (but I have high hopes since it TOTALLY RULES!). This a scary place in which to begin.

And now let’s say that those in power decide they want the landbase on which (or rather with whom) this community lives. What happens next? Does anyone really believe that those in power won’t destroy the community and steal the resources? This genocide isn’t a thing of the past: The Kayopo are being driven from their land right now, to make way for the Belo Monte dam.
Thank you for your time and happy gaming.
My only complaint with this book was the ending. I felt like it was far too abrupt than it should have been. It was like the author just got tired of taking them through trials and decided to end it instead of writing anymore. The ending felt very slapped on, instead of that we had finally reached that point where there was no other choice but to end the story.

The Beast Folk, as the half-human animals are called in the book, can also be interpreted as the natives of counties that the British Empire subjugated during the colonisation. Forcing people to give up their own culture and their ways in order to adopt the values, language and religion of Europeans is very clear since the Beast Folk have to live by rules that are not natural to them: don’t eat meat, don’t walk on all fours, don’t drink water from the stream by lying down on the ground. Eventually, the animals revolt (after having tasted blood) and they slowly revert back to their original form, claiming the island as theirs.

We hate the idea of being forced to join a union who then spends our dues money taken from us by force on politicians we wouldn't even piss on if they were aflame. We hate the fact that your racism is seen as kindness, while our realism is seen as racism. We hate that you're so blindingly ignorant, stupid and obtuse that you believe "diversity" is a good thing, never realizing that diversity only means different, not better or worse. We hate your unrealistic view of the world, seeking a false equality based on nothing more than existence without merit. We hate that no matter how many times we calmly explain the precepts of Natural Law, Liberty and Free Market Capitalism you're only retort is "Oh yeah? You're a racist/bigot/hateful/misogynist."
This does seem like I’m simply trying to find a religion in which to convert to so I can become a board-certified chaplain one day, but I view this more as furthering my journey along my path for the search of my own truth.

Tony my mechanic returned from holidays Sept. 3rd and I told him I was thinking of shutting the shop down. He was pretty freaked out that I might shut things down, but he understood. I’ve noted on Thurs., Sept. 5th “I’ve had enough! – told Lou” and that’s when I’d finally gotten to the point of no return at the shop and called my manager Lou. I had also called for final meter readings on my utilities. I have a slow fuse, but once it goes off, it’s immediate usually and this was the day I blew.

Excitement and nervousness stirred in our kids--uneasy about the unknown. We arrived at the school. The schoolyard was filled with children dressed in blue & white uniforms. The sheer numbers of students amazed us. Six years ago only 40 students attended. Today almost 600 students attend in two sessions--morning and afternoon. The wealthy Dominicans and nationals pay for their kids to go to school in the morning session. Then in the afternoon session the poor families especially the Haitian children go to school for free.

Reality. Yes, Paris is a huge tourist destination, and as a result is riddled with the cultural caricatures and commercial junk thought to appeal to the perceived lowest common denominator of taste and experience. But alongside that—sometimes literally—it is Parisian business as usual, the daily business of millions of people living and working in a complex urban ecosystem that has been growing and developing for centuries as the cultural and commercial heart of France, and which can absorb the vagaries of tourists along with any number of other incidents that occur in the daily round. Case in point: my visit to E. Dehillerin, the renowned kitchen store, where local chefs and clueless visitors are treated with the same brisk courtesy, and where the complicated system of actually making a purchase (involving at least 3 employees) remains unchanged, regardless of how many people are in line. It may not be the most convenient way, but it’s their way, and I’m glad to have experienced it.

The Prius c’s user interface is very much in the mainstream. As with many compact and subcompact cars there’s a digital display with the important info along the base of the windshield. On the c Two this includes an iPod-size version of the Liftback’s center-stack LCD (a center-stack LCD is optional, and standard on the c Three and c Four), which is controlled by a steering-wheel mounted button. A lot less distracting, actually.

Nursing has decreased a lot- especially now that we're down to one nap. He is really only nursing before the nap and before bedtime. Occasionally he'll ask for it between breakfast and lunch or between dinner and bedtime, but other than that, it's really only twice a day.

Interest in Eastern religions has been present for a hundred years and more in the West, and has been gaining especially in the 20th century; but it has always been a fringe movement in society, and only in the last decade or so have we seen the institution of native Western temples and monasteries, with seemingly normal American young men and women bowing to the ground before Buddhist and Hindu gods…

Continue from the previous issue, we are still now at the alleyway called “Trok Long Moo” or “Soi Sukon 1”. I personally call this alleyway as a “stomach feeder” area. This area in not only full of good food, but also 24/7 for food! In the morning you can find one thing. In the night, there will be other things to eat. From late night to early morning, you also can find another thing which is also eatable and riches taste! This alleyway is also really close to the Hua Lumpong train station (approx. 10 mins walking), china town or Yaowarat (approx. 5 mins by bus) so if you plan to visit the restaurant, there is also a lot of place that you can visit before or after the meal.

What to expect: You can expect their ages to range from older teenagers to young adults, they will most likely be either a boy or a girl. On occasion the distinction is unclear. They tend to wear ‘vintage’ clothes that normally smells like a billion year old man previously wore them. Items consist but are not limited to: leather slip on shoes -tight skinny jeans of various and vibrate colours – various patterned tights – checkered shirts – cut off jeans with frays – chinos – large scarfs – large pieces of jewellery often of retro origins and design – shirts that look like you are wearing a suit or other type of clothing.

When Mike Mignola tires (however briefly) of a steady diet of Hellboy, he turns to diversions such as creating The Amazing Screw-On Head.
Thus he becomes uncertain of his life, for what it is has been denied by him. It is for this denial that you need Atonement. Your denial made no change in what you are. But you have split your mind into what knows and does not know the truth. You are yourself. There is no doubt of this. And yet you doubt it. But you do not ask what part of you can really doubt yourself. It cannot really be a part of you that asks this question. For it asks of one who knows the answer. Were it part of you, then certainty would be impossible.

Today in Italy we celebrate the “Festa della Liberazione”, the 67th anniversary of the liberation of Italy from fascism and Nazi German occupation. A national holiday in Italy, this day will be marked by both commemoration and celebration – from solemn ceremonies of remembrance to parades, speeches and open air concerts in Italian piazzas. The biggest ceremony is held in Milan, the site some of the fiercest fighting, and of the grotesque public display of Mussolini’s body in the days that followed. However, despite the numerous events planned to mark the occasion at national and local level, the ‘festa della liberazione’ has never been a straightforward day of celebration for all Italians.
Enjoy whatever weather you have in your world,
First, we decorated the planting pots as "heads," as we were trying to grow "grass hair" on the heads. The children had fun doing this - some understood the concept more than others, but either way, the activity was enjoyed! We then took great delight in digging in the dirt and did the children did extremely well considering that four were asked to share each small bucket of dirt. We used small plastic spoons to "shovel" the dirt into our pots to help enhance the fine motor skills of those in need! The grass is really starting to fill in now... 3 weeks later. I had hoped to use wheat grass as it is the wider-blade grass that seems to grow and fill in quicker, however, I wasn't able to find any when I was at the store, so I ended up with a different, finer variety. For next year, I will definitely make sure to locate the wheat grass somewhere!

With this in mind, I’m going to do something a little bit different with you today. I’m going to give you a little break from thinking you’re a horrible mess, by allowing you to see what a horrible mess really looks like. You have all been working so hard up to this point; bearing your souls, naked before God and confessing your sins so that we might pray for one another and be healed of our sickness: the desire to rule over our husbands.

JS: I completely agree with you Jack. Horror writers are some of the most passionate out there. Writing good horror is hard. Really hard. Sure, you can gore things up and make a passage uncomfortable to read but can you really entice those reactions of actual fear out of a reader? Gore is uncomfortable but fear is primal. It’s not an easy feat to elicit fear mainly because not everyone reacts the same way to the same thing. I’m a firm believer that you have to immerse yourself in your work in order to get those reactions. As a horror writer, you owe it to your readers. Horror is defined in its plainest terms as an intense feeling of fear, shock or disgust. While I’m writing I like to build on those emotions, sometimes alone and sometimes in harmony. I find that the intense build to a singular moment can be a bigger pay off than injecting horrific moments just for horror’s sake. It’s that rollercoaster ride within the pages that sticks with you.
That’s a vexed question just now, and not only because the current US president used the word to get into office via one of the most monumentally cynical political campaigns of modern times. Even before it got stripped of its remaining content by Obama’s marketing team, the old virtue of hope had gotten tangled up in America’s culture of entitlement, and twisted completely out of shape in the service of cynical marketing disguised as cheap sentimentality. "When you wish upon a star, makes no difference who you are, anything your heart desires will come to you..." Readers of a certain generation will remember hearing that bit of doggerel out of the mouth of an animated insect. I knew a small boy who, after seeing the movie in question, took to singing, "When you wish upon a star, you don’t see things as they are." Like most children, he knew better, and hated being on the receiving end of lies. I sympathized, having had exactly the same reaction a quarter of a century earlier.
The funeral rites took place at the church of the Holy Trinity. It is estimated that between 10,000 and 30,000 people attended.

Schubert died the next year and was buried next to Beethoven.

When parents at one North Carolina school refused to return a library book that featured a gay main character, the issue drew mixed reactions and international attention. Some parents wrote to the school to ask that their child not be given access to the book. Conversely, others wrote to ask that their son or daughter read the text. Before the controversy settled down, 32 copies of the book were donated to the school’s library, from as far away as Australia.
So try a bottle of dolcetto and I guarantee you will fall in love with it. Look for Dolcetto D’Alba or Dolcetto D’Asti which are as authentic as you can get. If you are looking for California dolcettos, Santa Cruz has a few wineries which make outstanding dolcettos as well. And if you are going to pair it with food, make sure whatever you are making has tomatoes in it. Cheers.
Your web template is your first impression. It's like meeting someone for the first time. Would you make a good impression the way you are or does your site scream out every word with huge font type and bright colors as if by assaulting their eyes you are yelling in their ear. Do your products stand on their own, or are you going to CONVINCE the buyer that they HAVE to buy it by YELLING AT THEM. Or does trying to find an item on your site become a game of hide and seek because they have to click through a dozen links to get there? How about the text and pictures on your pages? Is it direct and to the point with perhaps a few pictures for accent or does the text go on and on and the visitor has to scroll for miles to get to the bottom of the page? If this describes your site then it's time to clean for clean up. Your site should be a pleasant experience for your visitors so they will want to come back time and again - willingly. Is it pleasant to look at and easy to navigate? Are your products, categories and pages well organized and easy to find? How about the essentials - an obvious link to view what’s in their cart, to get back to your home page and to contact you if needed? Your website is your best dress or suit. PUT IT ON and greet your potential buyers as if they are important to you. A sloppy website gives the impression of disorganization, unprofessionalism & a sloppy attitude.
Somehow I manage to complete my shopping in under four hours and head for the check-outs where my kids start in on a chorus of, “Can we have candy?” What evil minded person decided it would be a good idea to put a display of candy in the check-out lanes, right at a child’s eye level? Obviously someone who has never been shopping with children.
The final item I found was this metal, vintage, matchstick holder/dispenser. It has such a great red and green retro look. It would also make a great paperclip dispenser or key holder. I can imagine so many uses.

Yesterday, Mike and I returned from our FIRST EVER vacation together. (I suppose it is our second if you count our honeymoon, over two years ago.) We drove five hours to Gatlinburg, TN and stayed in a private chalet, complete with a hot tub on the back deck, called “A Lover’s Paradise.” Gatlinburg itself is an absolute tourist trap, but it is the gateway city into the Smoky Mountains National Park, which I enjoyed far more than I thought I would.

Why do chimpanzees throw poop? The federal government would like to know and is using your tax dollars to investigate the matter. Every single year, we all send huge amounts of our hard-earned money to the federal government. We hope that they will spend that money wisely. Unfortunately, that is simply not the case. You are about to read some examples of how the government is wasting your money that are absolutely mind blowing. Anyone that claims that there is not a lot of waste that can be cut out of the federal budget is lying to you. Our politicians have racked up the biggest pile of debt in the history of the world and they are spending our money on some of the stupidest things imaginable. It is imperative that the American people be educated about all of this outrageous government waste, because right now the political will to change this corrupt system is simply not there among the current crop of politicians in Washington. We are stealing trillions of dollars from future generations and many of the things that our politicians are wasting that money on are almost too bizarre to believe......
Ha ha. Where do I start? Oh hey, how about the beginning. Ohio Boy texts me @ 5pm to invite me to something that starts at 6. Er …… okay, I’m a loser & had no plans and his plans involved bar hopping, so hell yeah! Sign me up. Anyway, this event was hysterical, I can’t say the name of it because god forbid this blog comes up in a google search, but it involved 200+ people dressed as either Santa Clause or Mrs Santa and doing a pub crawl in South Scottsdale. Now, mind you, with such stellar notice and having no clue that everyone was dressing up, I did not. So here I am, in a sea of Santas, in jeans & a leather jacket (well, I was wearing more than that, but you get the idea). It was a total blast & everyone was really cool.
So, now that I'm able to smile without pain, eat soft food and be out of the house, I'm too busy doing all of the above to really have a good conversation with 'you', my imaginary friend.

How far will Rose go to keep a promise? The recent Strigoi attack at St. Vladimir’s Academy was the deadliest ever in the school’s history, claiming the lives of many. Even worse, the Strigoi took some of their victims with them - including Dimitri.

Push pull is easy when interacting with a woman when you are taking more of the teasing/playful approach and mixing it in with a little seriousness and showing of interest. IOW’s the woman is being pushed & pulled in different directions but in a good and exciting way. Also a man that can push pull in a flirting situation shows he is a bit more complex in his ability to not have a one track way of interacting with a woman. Most men flirt and show interest in one manner and keep going on that same route until they close. That’s fine but if you plan on interacting and engaging the woman for more than a few minutes, she’ll eventually start getting bored and want to end the conversation or she’ll start looking for outs (looking around for friends or others to mingle with).

Newcastle Occupation of the Fine Art building is coming to an end on Sunday 11th December by 2pm. This is a direct response to the actions of University management today, who have threatened not only University disciplinary action, but also began legal action.
One of the things I love on the coasts of the Cornish landscape is the miniaturisation of everything. The thorn trees are small and windskewed. The blue scabious is just a few cms tall. Wild thyme is tiny; the milkworts almost so small you barely see them.

The scene opens with "Tony" locking the doors. He sounds pretty upset about something. I wonder what's got him all worked up.
Love brings joy.
We see so many needy people, so many widows and prisoners and sick people who live so close to home. Often times, I think people think of missions as foreign service and forget to think about their own communities. Missions is not foreign service. It’s just service, in the name of Jesus as His authentic follower. That can be accomplished right here in my own community as well as across the globe. Times up.

Remember fitting yourself to the single-person comfy bubble, and finding a magical consolation in solitude?
Lackluster business efficiency, limited labor productivity, pathetic returns on investment and piling debt have haunted many State-owned firms. In particular, according to a government report presented to the National Assembly on November 1, 2010, 81 of 91 State-owned conglomerates and corporations incurred debt of about VND813.435 trillion. If Vinashin’s debt, which the Ministry of Finance puts at VND86 trillion, is included, State-owned enterprises’ debt as of late 2009 had been approximately 54.2% of that year’s GDP — even then, there are still nine corporations and conglomerates whose debt in 2009 remains uncertain and has therefore been excluded from the calculation. Again, these data shed light on the problems arising from dependence on State-owned enterprises for growth.
It took me many years to outgrow the 4-week course and to realise that there are ‘other options’. This is not to deny its power and its fitness for purpose, nor to feel less grateful for the incredible career it kick-started. But isn’t it time that some of the other options were given more credence? And more legitimacy?
Maybe you are a business exec or are employed at Dairy queen, you’ve a pay day.&nbsp America may be the area of business and the concept that you may need funds can now become more good when you work, a bank checking account plus a paycheck.&nbsp Loans are plentiful employing a limited-term cash advance Loan.&nbsp Depending on the report that that you dwell, on the internet payday Loans can be purchased from Bucks250 around Bucks1,000 and they are put into the account as part of your bank checking account by another day.
However, I also believe that there is absolutely a connection between some vaccines and the fact that 1 out of every 150 of our children is now being diagnosed with some form of Autism. So, like I said, a very sharp double edged sword that cuts both ways.

A few images started projecting on the wall. I was startled. All those pictures were of Damon and I. I stared at her blankly.

As I walked into the show floor, fellow guild members from 2 guilds and friends from the Country Quilter Retreat gang, came up offering their congratulations. I thanked them all, but still didn't know what for. The first quilt I saw was "In the Spotlight" with it's 2nd Place ribbon in the Appliqued Wallhanging - Human/Animal category and I was so happy. It got an "Honorable Mention" last month at the Empire Quilter's show. Then I turned the corner and to my surprise, there was "Mis Hijos" the portrait quilt of my children from a workshop with Bisa Butler and it received "Honorable Mention" in the small quilts category. I was soo happy...:-) 2 ribbons, just like last years show!! Well I continued through the show and I was stopped in my tracks..... there was "In a Blaze of Glory" with a 3rd place ribbon in the Appliqued Wallhanging category!!!
So now we have that bottom container with the two side stakes and 2 horizontal bamboos. Next I would fill it half way up with compost and then sink 2 open bottomed plant pots into the compost. Fill the plant pots with compost and put 1 Tomato plant in each pot - perfect Tomato grower and light enough to move around as needed.

It's a surprise birthday party for Korin Sutherland,
Saw the Avengers yesterday, it had me with a big smile on my face the whole time. Lots of cool stuff, extremely watchable all through, classic Hollywood pacing (which meant I knew when it was safe to take 2 minutes to go to the bathroom), and a big-ass set piece to finish it all off. Joss hit it out of the park just like I hoped he would and after the 15 years he’s had of struggling with studio execs I’m hoping he can do pretty much what he wants for the next few years. I’d love to see him infuse his next superhero movie with even more feeling.

The real question is – could people possibly lose their jobs due to visible tattoos?
Since we had a busy week getting ready for our birthday festivities, this picture is from the archives. For some reason there is often various construction equipment parked not too far from our house. I let my son climb up on this one so I could take his picture. The pictures I loved best was when I caught his reflection in the truck's mirror.

And the main reason for blogging about this is to appeal for money. The CTS will sell the booklets in parishes and bookshops, but the copies distributed by Ten Ten in their school work will be given away free of charge. Ten Ten are nowhere near their target of £3,500. If you have a heart for this kind of outreach, and an appreciation of how much support and encouragement parents need, please do think of donating something to the Ten Ten fund.
Some people are tut-tutting because the couple had unprotected sex when they barely knew each other. They forget that Hugh has STD check-ups as frequently as most porn stars. As for Miss Hong, she may well have been a virgin who was saving herself for Hugh. Ludicrous though it may seem, people in the Far East actually revere him as the epitome of an English gentleman. One hopes he deflowered Miss Hong with the delicacy she would have anticipated.
Intense, unstable, and conflicted close relationships, marked by mistrust, neediness, and anxious preoccupation with real or imagined abandonment; close relationships often viewed in extremes of idealization and devaluation and alternating between over involvement and withdrawal.
One More Tip:
Regular readers of this blog may recall that I have previously written about the Rothschilds, an international banking family whose wealth is said to be measured in the trillions of dollars. Intrigued by what I had discovered about this powerful dynasty, I investigated further and discovered that Lord Victor Rothschild was thought to be the unidentified fifth member of the Cambridge Spy known by the KGB as the 'magnificent five'.
Belief in thepower of God, plus enough willingness, honesty, and humility to establish and maintain a new order of things were the essential REQUIREMENTS. Simple, but not easy. A price had to be paid. It meant the destruction of self-centeredness. I must turn in all things to the Father of Light who presides over us all. (A.A. Page 13, 14)
“That’s what first attracted me,” says Thomas de Wesselow, an engagingly serious 40-year-old Cambridge academic. “I’ve always loved a mystery ever since I was a boy.” And so he became the latest in a long line to abandon everything to try to solve the riddle of the Shroud.
It was quite a cosmic set-up. Devotees of the church revered the sanyasis, the senior monks and nuns of the order. Of course they revered the ideal that we represented, but it was a little too easy to go along with the unspoken charade of being somehow separate and higher than the rest of the world. A seductive kind of spiritual arrogance would creep in. Try as one might to remain humble and to be authentic and real, the power of group-think and the tidal pull of living in close community with those who thought along the same lines made it difficult to think and act differently. In other words, the voice of the community and the role of monastic would more often than not overshadow and overpower the voice of my own heart, which was sublimated to such a degree that I came to consider body, mind and even my heart as a kind of enemy, something not to be trusted.
The same technique is used in the preparation of other Liguria’ specialties such as salsa di noci (walnut sauce), which I particularly love. I will share that recipe at a later time.
It's obvious that Amin is parroting back things that his father has said, but the dialogue, despite its casual delivery — and Amin gives a great, relaxed, naturalistic performance — also feels very much written, putting into this boy's mouth the kinds of things that are said about independent, thinking women in this culture. The rest of the film will further explore various attitudes about women in Iran, but right here at the start Kiarostami is establishing the dominant male perspective that women should be subservient and domestically oriented, a perspective that's apparently passed on from fathers to sons.

I decided that I had to run to the grocery store to buy soup for the restaurant, but while I was there, I realized that I was missing my bowtie. Suddenly I wasn't in the grocery store anymore, but I was at the mall trying to find a bowtie so I could go back to work and take care of my tables. I was running from store to store in the mall, freaking out that I had tables who were impatiently waiting for me and I couldn't go back until I found a stupid bowtie. (Yes, I know it makes perfect sense to leave your job in the middle of a shift to go shopping for formalwear.)

Although you you can't really see it in these photos I actually cut all the circles out of the white cardstock with a craft knife and then stuck pieces of patterned paper from the 6x6 paper pad behind the circles. You can see it quite clearly in real life and I think it looks much nicer than if I had of just cut the circles and stuck them on but then I am a sucker for punishment! The fab stitching stamp I used in between the circles is from an old set of Hero Arts stamps that has a load of different stitch stamps.

MUSEUM OF THIEVES is the first book in a new MG fantasy series. In the city of Jewel, all children below the age of 16 are tethered to their parents and the Blessed Guardians at all times. That might suit some children just fine, but when the 1st annual Separation Ceremony (where children become no longer bound by silver chains) where the Separation age was promised to be lowered to 12 is stopped, Goldie Roth runs away in frustration. With nowhere else and no one else to turn to, Goldie is drawn to the museum as shadows lurk in the dark. As she learns the secrets of the museum, trouble is brewing in the city, and the museum is in danger.
Love this time of year.
My day started with all the excitment and joy in my heart. So that, obviously, woke me up. It got me prepared as early as never before belived upon. Every person that was awake in the household told me that I was really, really excited. Which I was! Who wasn’t going to be excited with their firsts?! Since I was prepared, I waited for mom to wake up, so I could practice the piano.

In 1953, South Korea was a ruin. Three years of war between Communist forces (North Korean and then Chinese) and the Allied forces had seen Seoul switch hands four times, millions of people killed, millions more forced to flee their homes as refugees, massive infrastructural damage throughout the country, and the entrenchment of a partition line across the Korean peninsula which has split families up to this very day and inflicted unspeakable trauma on the Korean people as a whole. This devastating war started in 1950, only five years after the Korean peninsula (and therefore the whole of what would later become South Korea as well) had been liberated from an exceptionally brutal 35-year Japanese occupation which had inflicted massive violence, oppression, and suffering.

The dignity of the human race is blind to economic, or any other kind of status. Financially poor human beings of planet Earth have the exact same amount of dignity as human beings who find themselves richer in terms of financial wealth. Human beings who have more buttons, or beads, or animals, or cars, or flowers, or boxes, or shoes, or clothes, or vacations, or food, or houses, or boats, or motorcycles, or anything else they can think of, have just as much dignity as those who do not.

Not to be missed, in Mongkok (Kowloon side) there is the Bird Markets, Flower Markets and the tropical Fish Markets (a whole street full of shops selling tropical fish) all around Prince Edward Station. Wandering this area is a fantastic day of sightseeing - its one of my favourite parts of Hong Kong. Apparently it’s one of the most densely populated places on earth so you can see why there’s so much hustle and bustle. While you're in the area walk down Nathan Road through Mongkok, there are a few markets including the Ladies and Temple Street Markets that are interesting, although often pretty junky selling fakes but often good for a laugh. I would also recommend heading to the Jade Markets in Mongkok, there is good selection of really pretty Jade and also other jewellery made from lots of different stones. Remember to bargain ruthlessly when at these places. Head to One Dim Sum near Prince Edward Station for cheap and cheerful Dim Sum if you're peckish.

I must have been driving at over 150km/hr when I approached an intersection in wuse 2, around Ecwa church, instead of reducing acceleration and then honking so as to warn other road users coming from different directions, I tapped the horn twice and I saw it…. Two oval shaped headlights heading in my direction, I tried to slow down so as to steer clear of the intending car but it was too little too late, so I watched in slow motion as this car slammed into the driver side of my car at breakneck speed..contrary to belief that such deaths happen so fast that the victims hardly know what hit em. They were wrong, as I saw it all in slow motion…It was as if the angel of death was playing cruel jokes on me, more like he was tapping the slow motion button on the DVD remote control
On the score of my musical talents (or lack of them), so far I have tried to learn the piano, violin, sang in a choir (apparently my rhythm was good), played (very badly) the bag pipes and now the guitar… Maybe I should be handing out merit points to those who are game enough to put up with my musical tormenting (something akin to waterboarding).
I cannot emphasize how batshit gorram loco this is.
There are going to be less officers to deal with these ‘pressing issues’ and more are going to be standing their ground. For example there was a Grade A domestic, where a female was heard to be screaming and someone had rung it in. Officers were called up but the unit was on a meal break, the next unit was doing ‘paperwork’ and so a unit from another area had to come across. Officers were actually saying ‘No’ (not directly but basically) There was a time when everyone would call up, back up and deal, but now they are starting to dig their heels in- it is fair to say they are ‘pissed off’, and really who can blame them, now having to work out their own hours which are applicable for their ‘unsociable hours’, get it checked and signed off and send it in. Ridiculous.

Fear plays a major role in the life of Animists. They see the world as full of spirits, omens, spells and forces. Through magic, divination and sacred rituals, they seek protection to appease the gods, the spirits and the ancestors. They observe numerous taboos and prohibitions and observe sacred places. For example, in Haiti there is a sacred tree where a pact with the devil was signed over two centuries ago by witchdoctors. Animists see a whole host of objects as sacred things with sacred power. They recognize sacred persons and observe sacred actions. One of these is the circumcision rituals on young men in the Xhosa tribe. Many hundreds of men have died from these dangerous circumcision rituals.

Wallace, from Street And City Photos emailed me a lovely little note today, and it prompted me to look around his blog. Fantastic stuff! I love the realness of the subjects, how they're not perfect human specimens, not all of a single age group or gender, or adherents to a particular style. They're just interesting to look at, or have some quality that makes them stand out... And of course, the interesting people aren't just awesome subjects without a really good photographer behind the lens!
I have to preface this by saying I am a Jane Austen girl through and through. You know this if you know me. I have had debates about the appeal of Mr. Darcy compared to Mr. Rochester. Let me just say this right now: Toby Stephens is a close second to Mr. D in this version. There are a few scenes that SMOLDER! I am not kidding! I watched the entire thing on YouTube because DANG Netflix didn't have it, and still loved it! It's one I am going to have to own. I also finished reading JA right about this time, so it was nice to have it fresh on my mind. Great book, great movie version! WHEW!
Just a word about supplies purchased here. When we sold eggs, we needed equipment that held up, and was easy to clean. We ordered these items mail order, and have owned, used and abused them for 12 years. None of these cost anymore than the feed store counterparts and still have a lot of life left in them. The feeder is a Kuhl range feeder w/o rain shield, the nest box is a ”Kuhl 10-hole with closable perches and removable plastic nest bottoms, and the waterer is a Plasson bell waterer.

These are incredible back-to-back actions – working in behalf of the bankers who wrecked the world economy and then voting to withhold help from families impoverished by the bankers’ criminal incompetence. You’d think the constituents of some of these senators would catch on, but con men like Saxby Chambliss of Georgia take it for granted that they can get away with murder, and they do. All they have to do is lie about it. Sure, the mass media will also report what the liars’ adversaries say about an issue, but the two sides will be presented as though they’re both valid arguments even in instances when two minutes of Google research would expose the unassailable truth.

Well it is already the end of August and we are getting into the Fall season. I love the Fall time with leaves falling, color changing and the smell of fireplaces going. I love the temp. I am not a heat person I love 70's degree weather. I love the starting of the holiday season. this is why I am writing my blog today. My daughter in law who passed 4 years ago this month loved this time of the year. She came from Calif. and never saw the changing that happen in the months ahead of us. But she started her holiday season decorating around Sept. and kept it up till after December. This is for her my Maria. She was one in a million. She gave us a wonderful gift our grandson Nick and kept her house in tack with such love and devotion. She kept her home so clean and was always decorating somewhere or something. She collected Radko ornaments for her several trees she put up. She would change things around all the time.
Another key document cited in the Spanish case is a November 2002 "action memo" written by Haynes, in which he recommends that Rumsfeld give "blanket approval" to 15 forms of aggressive interrogation, including stress positions, isolation, hooding, 20-hour interrogations and nudity. Rumsfeld approved the document.
The latest stop on the year long adventure was the Grand Ole Opry, the largest country and western club in the UK. It's a fantastic but very rarely used venue for gigs in Glasgow and located in a part of the city over in the south-west which in places hasn't changed since the 60s or 70s. There's no better illustration of this than our rendezvous for the pre-gig drinks...a pub called The Old Toll Bar...a pub for which the word traditional may very well have been invented.
All playoffs come with stars but this series really has it all. Henrik Lundqvist, the do it all goalie who was on the cover of Sports Illustrated and is single handedly one of the reasons the Rangers are in the playoffs. Chris Kreider, the lovable rookie who just turned 21 this week and continues to help the Rangers when he is most needed. Ryan Callahan, the captain who always seems to come through in the clutch. The Caps have Alex Ovechkin. While he hasn’t been as dominant as of late, he has the ability to heat up and really bring it.
Why did God do this for us? Because he loves us. That’s it!

Then, I became disabled for any real work, and Josh returned. He would either ask me or come right out and tell me what projects I needed help with, and then he would do them. Sometimes, he would mow the grass or rake the leaves without even letting me know (of course, I figured it out when I heard the mower), and he always seemed to do them right when I needed help the most. Other times, I would do a job alone that Josh had told me I needed help with, and he would get mad when he found out. Only he wouldn’t tell me he was mad; he would tell his mother, and she would pass it along. Then I’d start thinking about how I might get back on Josh’s good side. This was never hard because I don’t think he has it in him to hold a grudge against a friend.

Now here is where it gets interesting. The Eskenazis did not actually *pay* for their stake in YPF. The terms of the crooked deal struck by the equally Jew-ridden government which brokered the original deal between the Spanish oil company and the then-floundering YPF - which was completely broke and so corrupt and inefficient that it could not even finance new exploration despite Argentina's abundant oil and gas resources - insisted that Repsol buy the shares on behalf of the Jewish Eskenazis which they would then pay for out of their share of future income streams! Have you ever heard of such a deal?

I've also been working on my blog. I'm not a computer girl at all so learning new things on here takes me a very long time. I'm finding it easier to learn new things on blogger than I can on Facebook. I usually think about it for a long time before I have the courage to try it. I've wanted to create "Pages" on my blog to make it easier for everyone to find whatever your looking for. This will be a work in progress for awhile. Hopefully this will make it easier for you to contact me, look thru layouts and cards, you can also see upcoming workshops and crops and for those that would like to, you can also shop from my CTMH site. If you would like to hold a CTMH party or an online party you can also contact me. If you have any suggestions, ideas or things that you would like to see changed please let me know. You can comment here or email me at papermemories4u@yahoo.com.
Are you one of those people who still feels a nostalgic desire to keep the penny around? Don’t get me wrong… there is a lot to be said for nostalgia. I’m one of those relics who can actually remember buying penny candy as a child and looking forward to having some coins. But times have changed. I actually saw a gumball machine this week that took quarters, and the gumballs were not particularly large. So is it time to get rid of the penny?

That sounds like a great solution, until one considers the fact that a giant, orbital mirror is not far off from being a super-weapon the likes of which Dr. No would have given a body part to have owned. Any dastardly evil villain would love something like that. And other nations would basically object to the sudden weaponization of space, making it a very complicated situation. Who decides who gets to affect the entire planet with one device? And who is responsible if it goes wrong with unintended consequences? All these thoughts planted the seed for a piece of my latest book, Arctic Rising, which looks at the many complications and ins and outs of climate change from the perspective of a thriller.

I decided to jump on the chalk paint bandwagon that I have read so much about in blogland. Of course, I made my own. Cheap, remember? I used this recipe, and it seemed to work just fine. I did fill in chips and lightly sand every part that was getting painted, but I did not prime, and I used wax instead of a poly coat. I have to say that I really like the feel of the finish and I will probably never do a poly coat again (unless it's kitchen cabinets).
What I have never understood is why a British patriot would be so into German Nazism, and the way the Nazis did things, in the first place. The British have their own ways of doing things. The German National Socialists, who were of a specific historical period (1921-1945), had their own very German way of doing things. What’s British about German National Socialism? Why do British Nazis want to mimic German Nazis? This is like Pakistani Muslim youths in Keighley and Bradford parroting Bronx blacks.

I’m just trying to make a point that it’s silly to ask a vegan how they get their protein. I always explain that my mom raised us on a vegetarian based diet, and thus I’ve always been conscious of what is necessary to fill out a well-rounded diet, and how to get those necessary things. I would love to eat only french fries all day. Not the best idea.
I retreated to regroup my senses and work out what to do next. Naturally, my first concern was for that of the birds' welfare. However, on inspection I found that they all seemed well and remarkably slick-free. I imagine that the explosion was so violent that it didn't even get a chance to cling to any feathers. As a precaution, they all got a bum wash regardless. This wasn't greeted with any enthusiasm, and Mabel was particularly aggrieved. Considering that this was her second bath in a month, perhaps she had the right to squawk indignantly throughout. Once the hens were dealt with, I braced myself to return to the scene of the crime.

I am currently finishing up my capstone project in school. And by finishing, I mean, I've barely started and there are only a few weeks left. However, my function in this aim is to develop and design a brewery. Unbeknown to most, I have no intentions of presenting any work nor having anything significant on D-Day. However, I do plan on having a solid document of information channeling what the brewery (or now, moreover, Brew Pub), is going to look like and effectively, live up to (although June says this will change and I am in firm belief with him that it will, however it is necessary to have a place to start), in hopes of sharing this information with potential investors in the process known as making DaveDave REAL.

But early Sunday morning I was watching MSNBC’s Up With Chris Hayes and they played a clip of Mr. Romney back in January on stage and telling a conservative audience that he believed that a mother with a child as young as two years old should be forced to go outside the home and work for a living in order to earn some social dignity. He said that his statement might sound harsh but he was willing to have the government pay more in order to supplement a welfare program to separate a child from his or her mother rather than pay less and leave the child’s rearing to the mother, the one person more than any other who we believe will work hardest to keep the child safe and to watch out for their well being. It might sound harsh, but Mr. Romney is willing to pay more to put the child at a higher risk of something happening to it.
Then I ride and we are making great progress in some areas and encountering blocks in other areas. The trot work, which needed the most improvement, is going well. He's becoming more forward and supple. We do a circle at each end and when we've warmed up with that for a bit we do three loop serpentines. The serpentines really help with getting the 'flow' of switching bend and keeping rhythm through turns. I'm pleased with our progress here. Rogo is really improving use of his hindquarters and at times booms down the long sides. I look forward to the day when this power is there most of the time and carries through the corners rhythmically.
Tirosh-Becker also publishes a large number of quotations from the previously-lost Mekhilta of Rabbi Shimon b. Yohai. This is a real find, and the author promises an article soon with Menahem Kahana on their value (see pp. 112-115 for a discussion, and pp. 856-882 for the quotations). There is a disproportionately large amount of quotations from this Mekhilta in the corpus, pointing to its prominence in Babylonia (indeed, the Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael was sometimes called “the Palestinian Mekhilta”). Many of these quotations are from parts of the Mekhilta not attested in known Genizah fragments, and were reconstructed from the fourteenth century Yemenite Midrash Hagadol twice: by D. Z. Hoffmann, and by J. N. Epstein. The latter was more conservative in his reconstructions, but several quotations discovered by Tirosh-Becker actually support Hoffmann’s more extensive reconstructions. However, these quotations, as far as I could see, are not marked in any way as derived from the Mekhilta, and in some cases (see e.g. pp. 859, 860-862) I’m curious why the author thinks they are from this work and not simply from one of the Talmuds, which contain similar material.

Her unhappiness, or frustration, was a very subtle subplot in the movie but very well delivered by JoBeth. The oldest child, Dana, was an unruly 16-year old teenager flirting with construction workers on her way to school. (Do the math! Can you say, “Shot gun wedding”?) Robbie, the middle child, was constantly taunting both his older and younger siblings. The point of highlighting this familial grief was to accentuate Diane’s coming full-circle with embracing and fully accepting family life and motherhood when Carol Anne was sucked into her closet and trapped in some sort of netherworld, only being able to communicate through the static of an un-aired channel on the television. (Thank goodness they didn’t have satellite!)

To protect the interests of the working class it would be necessary to nationalise the banks and cancel the debt held by foreign big business and financial institutions, while protecting the savings of working people. It would also be necessary to take over the commanding heights of the economy (with minimum compensation on the basis of need) to ensure the supply of essential goods and services. Priority should be given to reconstructing public services such as health, education, etc. Control of the economy should be through bodies of democratically elected representatives from the trade unions, community organisations, and the wider public. On a capitalist basis there is no easy way out.
--When I'm in a space where I hear many disrespectful remarks, insults and slurs, I usually leave. If I can't, I find myself focusing my attention on women, people of color, and queer people in the space, hyper-aware of little things happening to them and silently imploring the crowd to leave them alone.
So if that is not worldview defense I would like to know what would be. It is worldview defense carried to the extent of an extreme mental pathology. So, as I have often previously remarked, Leftists are great projectors -- they attribute to others things that are really true of themselves. So to find out what is true of them, just listen to what they say about conservatives. Prof. P. was so alive to the phenomenon of worldview defense precisely because it fills the heads of many of his fellow Leftists -- and maybe even his own head.

When I lived in Corvallis, I lamented the dearth of local craft brewpub options. At that time there were two, neither really meeting the definition of a true brewpub: Oregon Trail Brewing at the Old World Deli and the, then new, McMenamins on Monroe. In the last few years however two exceptional brewpubs have opened: Block 15 (on which I waxed rhapsodic previously) and now Flat Tail Brewing.

Place pan in center of oven and bake for 45 minutes. Check with a cake tester or skewer, or when cake begins to pull away from pan. I trust the skewer insert method over the touch method on this type of cake. When skewer comes out clean of crumbs (not sugary mixture) immediately remove from oven and invert on a cake platter. Tap top of pan or carefully bang plate on counter to loosen cake. Replace any stuck apples to the top of cake (hopefully, there will be few) and allow cake to cool at least an hour before serving.

The HBG crew arrived later than normal this year - with the addition of per-ordained time slots, there's really not much reason to get there too early (though one gentleman set up shop at 3am). Although we were deep in the line, we knew what to expect, and things moved pretty quickly once the doors were opened. I was also well on my way at that point, thanks to our cooler bag and the help of the folks near us in line.

Isn’t she just a doll! How can some girls, just be born with so much black hair? Just like her mom and dad! She has two big sisters, and looks very similar to her sister that is closest to her in age. I took pictures of her on Saturday afternoon, with natural light, but I rather take pictures earlier in the day, as the sun isn’t as harsh and unpredictable. I have noticed a lot of variation in the pictures because of the light. I may just have to take a few more portraits, so I feel totally satisfied…and sneak a few of her big sisters in, too! Once again, this brand newborn, 1 week old, was checking out my camera! Even with the room heated, her session made her hungry, and wide awake! In years to come, better watch out Dad, the boys will be after her! She already is such a cutie!

The Calvert County Historical Society, Inc. was founded in 1953 by a small group of concerned Calvert County residents. On May 5, 1954, articles of incorporation were made part of the public record which stated that the main purpose of the Society was to further the collection of historical data and records concerned with Calvert County and other materials bearing on the history of the State and Nation, including private letters, documents, manuscripts, early events and acts as recorded in structures and works of public and private nature. From a newly established Headquarters Room on site at Linden, visitors can find a wealth of valuable early county history. Gifts to the Society over the years have been varied and interesting, and have made important contributions to the understanding of the uniqueness and richness of the County's history. The research library continues to grow in volume and diversity. Family papers describing first person accounts of historical events, wills, family Bibles, original manuscripts, photographs, published histories and a growing video library are but a small part of the collection. Portraits, pieces of furniture and artifacts have also been entrusted to the Society's care.

"I really liked the way “Stay Focused Nikon D60” was organized by problems and solutions to those problems, rather than a step-by-step rundown of all the features. It groups the most common problems that people experience and puts them into different chapters. Each issue offers several different solutions depending on the specific conditions. For instance, a photo can be too dark for several different reasons and each one is fully explained with its individual solutions. The sample photos do a great job at illustrating both the problem and the fix. This makes it easy to jump around reading the items that pertain to your most pressing needs.

A favourite early scene that takes place during Steve's rope learning period features Al Pacino asking Powers Boothe's "Hanky Salesman" about the handkerchiefs that are hanging in his shop. If I heard this right, a light blue hanky stuffed in your left back pocket means you like to receive oral sex, while a light blue hanky sticking out of your right back pocket indicates that you give oral sex. When it comes to green, the left back pocket signifies you're a hustler, and the right implies that you're a buyer. Moving on to yellow, the left is all about receiving golden showers, and the right means you give them. Just as he was about to explain what the colour red represents, Al's character bails. Which is a shame, because I was dying to know what the red hanky stood for. I'm gonna go ahead and assume that it had something to do with anal fisting. Anyway, like Steve, I was a little confused by the yellow hanky. And not by what constitutes a "golden shower" (people peeing on one another for erotic or malicious purposes goes back thousands of years), but by which pocket meant what.

The home we are buying, however, isn't in such great shape. Right now, you would probably go walk through it and think we were crazy, just insane for buying this house. It is one of those homes that when you read the description on the MLS listing it reads something like this. "Lots of potential! Needs some TLC. A fixer-upper! Handy-man special!" But the location and price are well worth putting some work into it to make it our own. We are looking at a project about the size of this one.

CF: Probably the biggest worry for me at the moment is that Series 2 will be as well received as Series 1. I got some really good reviews for Series 1 for which I was very grateful, and I am working my hardest to make sure that Series 2 is even better. As far as surprises go... that would be telling, but I can tell you that this is the year of the Trojan and that the Doctor’s hearts will be broken. The plot arc is a lot less subtle this time around, but should hopefully smack you clean between the eyes when all is revealed. This is also why the finale to this series runs to 3 parts instead of the traditional 2. Oh, and of course, nobody knows just what those pesky guardians of time are up to yet!

On the bus, the girls meet a colorful character named Shonda. Caroline also calls Carvel “white trash ice cream”. Max tells Caroline a story about how her mom flaked on her 10th birthday, so she stole $20 from her purse and got herself an ice cream cake. In the prison, Max worries that they won’t be able to get in since they didn’t call ahead to be put on the list. Caroline tries to bribe the officer with $50, but he doesn’t budge. Max suggests the officer can feel her up if they can go through, and the officer allows it. After the full body search, Max and Caroline wait for Caroline’s dad. A one-night stand of Max’s named Irish, who’s a fellow prisoner, comes up to her and tells her he loves her. Max and Caroline try to tell him it was just a one nighter, but he gets angry and starts a fight with the guards. The fight causes the visiting hours to get cut, and Caroline only gets to see a glimpse of her dad before the guards rush her away. Max apologizes to Caroline and says she’s a terrible BFF, but Caroline says it’s fine. Max gets a Carvel cake for the “bang bus”. Caroline thanks Max because she got what she wanted for her birthday, to see her dad. The total for their cupcake shop is $625.

Jk has a beautiful voice, but is often shy when singing by herself, even though when I led the Children’s Choir at our old church, she would sing solos and duets if I needed her to. Her Homeschool Director has been working on getting Jk to come out of her shell and have confidence in her abilities, and tonight I saw some of that confidence shine through. Jk loves to sing for Jesus, and I hear her all the time singing in her room, or in the shower, but I think that knowing that mom has a degree in music makes her feel that she won’t measure up, even though I often tell her that I think she has a beautiful voice but that her heart for Jesus makes it an amazing gift that she could use for the glory of God. She has often seen me sing in church and other things and I think she is afraid that she isn’t good enough. But she is, and so I have hoped being with another encouraging music teacher would let her see that she is good enough to share her gift with others and use it for God.

” I started the outreach with Judy from Stewardship In Action. I wanted her with me because I was new to the whole neighborly outreach process, plus, living in a rural area, my neighbors are pretty reserved. In fact, I had the longest conversation I have ever had with one set of neighbors because of this project; even though we have lived next to each other for years. They were happy to learn of the free plants and labor they would get through Stewardship in Action. The next neighbors, who also live on the creek, were worried that this project might infringe on their right to own horses on a creek. We assured them that it would not.

The whole idea was to get a nice, big home for the kids.
Today is my turn for a challenge,
Tao and Takeo awaken to see a weird scene. Inside of me, I’m laughing at their expressions, particularly Tao’s confused one. M-21 and Regis sighing because of Tao and Takeo…yeah, I can definitely see the partnership. M-21 and Regis really are good ‘together’ while Tao and Takeo are good ‘together’. And no, not that kind of ‘partnership’, you perverts.

Before that they sent me a message saying "drayton, thanks for joining our VIP list!" - which of course I never had - before explaining that their new scam will be the largest MLM launch online. Nice to know that besides ripping me off with some dodgy rubbish they're going to con me on some video deal.

It may be noted that all the examples of conspicuously "caring" conservatives given above were also imperialistic or militaristic conservatives (generally both). This makes them somewhat unusual in the conservative tradition -- particularly in the American conservative tradition, which is isolationist rather than expansionist or aggressive. The basic conservative dictum: "You leave me alone and I will leave you alone" translates into an international policy of letting other nations go to hell in their own way as long as they don't threaten or attack America. So it has almost always been Democrat Presidents that have deployed American military power abroad on a large scale.

Ideally you have to eat this on the Chowpatty beach, watching the sea and the sun set while a warm breeze blows by. Soon after you finish this, you need to get yourself a chuski/ice lolly to cool you down. That is ideal, but it can be happily consumed anywhere in the world. Happy pao bhaji eating.
Grease a baking sheet, separate dough in half and form each half into an 8″ log about 1/2″ thick on the baking sheet. Bake for 20 minutes. Cut each log diagonally into at least 8 slices. Place slices cut side down on the baking sheet and bake for another 8 minutes. Flip pieces over and bake for 8 more minutes.
Talk about a timely sermon today. Pastor Gary definitely brought it today and it is something I need to remind myself at different times (I won't go into details, but thankful for the sermon).

As a principal, I listened, awe-struck by our teachers’ insights and their openness to reflection and learning. As if looking into a mirror, rather than observing a peers’ classroom, our wonderings and questions reflected not sage guidance we could offer others, but thoughtful musings on how we could improve our own practice. At first I was quiet, too quiet, taking in classroom experiences through the lens of our teachers, amazed by how much more I can absorb when buttressed by the perspectives of teachers than I can on my own solitary daily classroom walkthroughs.
Help children to appreciate cultural diversity by comparing how Mother’s Day is celebrated in Spain with how we celebrate it in England. In Spain, Mother’s Day takes place on the first Sunday in May, rather than in March. They celebrate it in much same way as we do, with cards and presents.
Weishaupt’s Illuminati began humbly with only five members, but after a few years and with powerful connections, the Order became a major political force across the world. Influential deciders, rich industrials, powerful noblemen and mysterious occultists joined the Order and participated in its conspiratorial objectives. Some historians claim that the Order’s quick rise to success was due to a secret meeting between Weishaupt and a mysterious figure named Cagliostro, the most powerful occultist of the time.

Pynchon's Gravity
For those of you who don’t know, on December 10th we were playing our biggest rival, Yorktown. I subbed into the game early in the first quarter and made it two or three times down the floor, but on the fourth time I had a terrible accident. I went to drive hard down the lane, planted my right foot hard as a defender stopped my drive, and when I turned to kick out to the opposite corner my knee went but my foot didn’t. I heard (and felt) a loud pop as my knee hit the ground. When I tried to stand back up, I put pressure on my right foot and I felt my kneecap start to shake violently on its own inside my leg. I was shocked, but didn’t want to cry on the court. The official stopped the game and trainers came running on to the court. My teammate, Sam, carried me off the court along with the trainer who took me to his office. Misty (Delta’s trainer), Kevin (Yorktown’s trainer), and a few student trainers all examined me. Misty said, “Did you hear a pop?” I nodded. “You’re gonna need to go to Central Indiana Orthopedics to get this checked out, but don’t be surprised if he says it’s a torn ACL.” I started bawling at this point. I knew that meant I wouldn’t be able to play anymore, let alone run track. That part sucked the most for me.
“How do you know that?” Mellie furrowed her brow. “Have you been reading my mind?”

How long is it before the general public assumes we are all lazy bags of hair who collect a paycheck while doing the least amount of work possible because we only got into this profession for the summers off anyway? How long before the general public just accepts that public schools can be equated with failing schools? And how much longer after that before it becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy?

You’ll know what I’ve done now. I’d apologise, but it’d be futile. I know you’ll think less of me and I’m sorry about that, but I can’t possibly stay. I didn’t fight and survive to sit in sheltered domesticity with a wife and a child. I didn’t even intend to stay in England. I admit I’ve made mistakes, but I can’t allow those mistakes to trap me here for the rest of my life just because you want me to be a better man than I am. My people are fighting for our land, and I need to be part of it.

Much of what I have written above relates to my philosophy of undergraduate teaching. I have enjoyed significant interaction with out graduate students as well, despite the fact that we offer no degree in Latin American History. I have forged this ground for myself because I value graduate education highly. I taught History 510 three time from 2008-2010. As our Foundations class, 510 is a joy to teach in part because of the practical skills of reading, analysis, and communication that form its core. Readings are often theoretical and outside of the scope of experience many of our graduate students bring with them. I have also taught seminars on the Spanish Conquest and on the authority and power in the early modern Spanish Empire. More importantly, outside of the seminar room I have sought opportunities to support and train our graduate students, most notably with the Dissertation Writing Group (DWG) I founded and have directed since 2007. With 510 and the DWG, I have had pleasure of being a sort of bookend for our PhD students progress, from the foundational skills of 510 through their realization in writing the dissertation.
I have no idea what prompted that one, but it made me giggle even today!
Tonight I am so thankful for so much. I have been thinking about how fortunate I am. I have problems and stress like everyone else. I feel sad and cry sometimes, too. I endure loss, physical pain and overwhelming grief just like everyone around me. However, I remember who my Father is and that he is with me always. He has given me everything I need and blessed me with truly beautiful people around me.

She resides in a suburb of Cincinnati, Ohio with her husband, twin teenaged sons, and a dachshund named after Rudyard Kipling. In her spare (!) time, she enjoys performing in live theatre, watching films, reading, and walking in the woods. An avid believer in a balanced life, she meditates and eats chocolate daily.

I “met” Sarwat Chadda online via the SCBWI-BI writers’ list and subsequently through Facebook and the blogosphere. He was kind enough to send me a proof copy of Devil’s Kiss and I thought I’d share a little about it with you and also an interview with Sarwat.
We did eventually find a nice enough looking hawker centre to stop at. A coffee later, and we were on our way again. No time to dawdle, as we want to be back in Penang tonight, after shopping in KL. Later the landscape became flatter, we started to encounter towns, which were quite congested, and then we approached the motorway into KL, and arrived in our destination a little after 11AM. The trip took about seven hours.
33) De Librije (Zwolle, Netherlands)
Having been in the play, and having read the play multiple times based on Judith Guest’s novel, I made the assumption that the film would be about Conrad Jarrett (Timothy Hutton), since he very much seemed to be the focus of the play. And yes, in many ways, the film is about him, which is why it seemed so strange to me going in that Timothy Hutton won the Oscar for Supporting Actor. After all, he’s on screen a lot of the film—isn’t he the lead?
We all know students learn in different ways, but how do we teach the same concepts to multiple learners with different abilities? The core of differentiated instruction comes from understanding and nurturing differences among learners, how they learn, learning preferences and individual interests. Classroom technology is providing teachers various avenues to reach multiple learners with different abilities at the same time. From a case study from a teacher in Kansas, find out how hardware, software and the web are enabling educators to personalize instruction while enhancing learning.
Undoubtedly one way or other we all are effected by corruption, but what we are forgetting here that apart from corruption, there are some other issues equally important and do need our attention...but somehow these issues are getting escaped or untouched from our drawing room discussions. They do not touch us in a real sense bcoz we urban class people never experience these issues.....

During sleep, our brain releases inhibiting substances to prevent us from acting out our dreams fully, although we may toss, turn and even talk in our sleep. The feline brain works similarly. In laboratory experiments where unfortunate feline subjects have had their brains tampered with so that those substances aren’t released, the cats act out their dreams in full. Even laboratory-bred cats which have never hunted, or even seen prey, have been observed to ‘catch birds’, ‘chase mice’ and ‘bat prey’ in the course of their dreams.

Today was spent making all kinds of delicious chocolate confections. We turned my Mom's house into Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory. With Christmas music playing on the radio and all the Christmas lights turned on, we melted pounds and pounds of chocolate, and made all kinds of chocolate confections to give to friends as Christmas gifts.

Do beards still exist in the modern world? Some people have jumped to the conclusion that George Clooney’s latest girlfriend is a beard, merely because she used to be a professional wrestler. That doesn’t follow at all. Being attracted to a female who can put you in a headlock has nothing to do with being gay, as any male gorilla will tell you.

The sequence of how everything happened “behind-the-scenes” is difficult to say, but the stage-prop increase in the project size occurred at roughly the same time that Forest City Ratner was dealing with Ms. Burden and her Department of City Planning. Though substantial contemporaneousness is clear, the exact sequence is difficult to lay out because while indicative dates are public, not all of the dates that would determine a full sequence are out. The swelling in scope of the project’s size occurred around the date of September 5, 2005, the date when a draft project scope came out that added 2800 condominium units. The Observer article appearing not long after that indicates that, as of the time it was published, Ms. Burden and the Department of City Planning had been dealing with the project for a while. The Department of City Planning informed Noticing New York that the Department started looking at the project “in 2004.” The date of the Observer article is November 22, 2005 and it is the Observer article that mentions both that “Burden says she is happy with the project as a whole” and that she was saying she didn’t have “veto power” over the project. Although the article it mentions the superblocking concern associated with Pacific Street being eliminated, there is no mention of a City Planning concern about the project’s size. The City Planning Commission’s official assessment of Atlantic Yards is in a September 27, 2006 letter that was released with the announcement of “the reduction.” (The Planning Commission is distinct from the Planning Department though they function together and both are headed by Ms. Burden.)

My standard response to this response about police mental health awareness training – EVERY SINGLE TIME – is that such claims may well be true, but mental health and social care professionals needs more “police awareness training” around procedures and law. Most AMHPs I’ve met, can’t explain s135(1) properly, for example – although many can. Most mental health nurses on wards who are asking for patients to be arrested following assaultative behaviour, don’t realise that we arrest people to commence and investigative and criminal justice process, not for the convenience of NHS staff. If there is no complaint of an offence or no evidence of liability, arrests don’t occur however desirable someone may think that would be. (You should see the list of people I’d arrest in a fantasy world where we do it because I think it would be a good idea.)

Have you ever asked yourself why, despite more than ten years of efforts –involving, among other things, the loss of thousands of lives in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, well-over a trillion dollars spent, countless man-years wasted waiting in airport security lines and endless efforts to ensure that no offense is given to seemingly permanently aggrieved Muslim activists – are we no closer to victory in the so-called “war on terror” than we were on 9/11?
No, no need to worry. The short story is merely hiding out in the novel until it is safe to come out. And soon it will be safe to come out. Because the internet is creating a vast new habitat that has not yet found its final shape, or final inhabitants. Cyberspace is ripe to be colonized by the small and nimble vole of the short story, who will change his form to suit the new terrain. But it will still be short, and still a story. It’s going to be alright.

You can make a spear either by sharpening a strong stick with your pocket knife and then hardening it in the fire, or by lashing your knife onto the end of a stick using vines. The latter is more efficient, but you risk losing your knife in the water if you aren't careful. In a real life-or-death survival situation, your pocket knife is your life line, so you don't want to take any chances with it. Since ours wasn't really a life-or-death situation, the boys chose whichever method they were comfortable with, and we had a mixture of both among the group.

Remember the coke can I mentioned earlier? Coke cans have a shiny, concave bottom. Not quite shiny enough for what we need, but it's a start. If you take some fine-grained sand from the bottom of the creek and use it as an abrasive, you can polish the bottom of the can to a mirror finish in no time at all. Now, what's a shiny, concave surface good for? Well besides a mirror, it works very well as a magnifying glass. All you have to do is aim it toward the sun, find the focal point of the reflector, and hold something flammable there. In about 5 seconds, you get fire. Though it was pure luck that we found the coke can out there, I had a backup plan too, just in case (always have a plan B - that's the first rule of survival). My canteen has a similar concave bottom and would have worked just as well for that purpose. Or if you wear glasses, you can use them too. But it was instructive for the boys to see it done with an empty coke can, plus we removed a piece of litter and cleaned up the forest a little bit in the process.

Mysterious deaths have occurred because the size of the bribes offered have been so huge, those who received the largesse would do ‘anything’ to hang onto their new-found but unsavory wealth.

Tonight during dinner, we heard a high pitched whistling sound coming from the formal dining room. It was at this point my mind flashed to the gopher in Caddy Shack. Were the squirrels out to get us? Upon further investigation, we discovered a squirrel running around the skylight area and back and forth across the rafters. We tried to encourage it to leave, but the high whistling sound continued. It was obvious the little guy was in distress for some reason. We assumed it couldn’t figure out how to leave, until The International Man of Intrigue went to the other side of the dining room for a better look and discovered another squirrel hovered in the doorway. It had either fallen or climbed down and couldn’t get back up. The International Man of Intrigue walked softly closer, speaking in a calm voice, assuring the little squirrel he was only going to open the door so it could go back outside. Too bad she wasn’t buying it. She darted across the dining room as he opened the door. Luckily, she seemed young and confused and didn’t hide, so she was quickly herded back outside.

Further down the list was the EEO form, which wants to know my gender (male or female) and ethnicity. I left that blank as well, although given the choice, I would identify with the female gender. If I had freedom to dress as I choose, I would not go 24/7 but I'd either be part male/part female or all female. Even now, some days I'm in all female clothing, although appearing male.
When most people think of the economic decline that is happening in America, most of them think of states like California and cities like Detroit. In both cases, unemployment is rampant, government finances are a mess, and businesses and families are both leaving in droves. So what is causing this? What do California and Detroit have in common? Well, for one thing, both the state of California and the city of Detroit have been run by anti-business socialist control freaks for decades. Once upon a time millions of young Americans that dreamed of a better life flocked to California and Detroit was one of the most vibrant manufacturing cities in the history of the world. But now both of them are in an advanced state of decline, and a lot of the blame can be placed at the feet of the politicians in both cases. Both California and Detroit have become very unfriendly places to businesses and families, so businesses and families have been leaving both California and Detroit in very large numbers. At the same time, the socialist welfare policies in both places have caused them to become magnets for those that enjoy being dependent on the government. Welfare recipients are not likely to pack up and move down to Texas because they know that their benefits would not be nearly as good down there. So both California and Detroit will continue to attract those that want to live under socialist control freaks and it will continue to drive away those that do not want to live under socialist control freaks.
I told her a little about camp, but she didn’t seem interested. My mom met us, and struck up a conversation, and after that I didn’t talk any more. That afternoon, as I tried on various pants and shirts, I felt truly free. I could walk away from her and not care.
4) Students write a paragraph about their mother. Their opening sentence can be "Are you my mother?" I also have them use this for their final sentence. I am sorry I don't have a closeup of the actual writing. Here is a sample: Are you my mother? My mother has blonde hair and brown eyes. She loves to wash dishes and does them every night. My mother is a great reader. I love it when she reads to me. We go to the library once every week. My mother is a wonderful cook. I love her spaghetti! I love my mother and she loves me! Are you my mother?

It’s been said by some that a working class Scot has more in common with the working classes in other nations than with other Scots who aren’t ‘working class’ and that there’s a ‘Social Union’ of shared values and mutual cultural interests which binds all on these islands together and which will survive Scots independence. There is little, if anything, to support either of these affectations, they appear as confections created to bolster political positions. I have cousins who are English, born on the Albion side of the border and have lived there ever since, proud of where they come from and proud, too, of their nation. They’re my family and always will be – even during World Cups – but I have more in common with those who have chosen Scotland for their home.

Don Rober began the bath by dipping the water out and pouring it right over me, covering me head to toe with several waterfalls. This may be the hot jungle, but that river water is very cold – so cold and unexpected that I could not help but squeal loudly as I took huge breaths, my heart racing. Don Rober laughed and began his ministrations with smoking a mapacho of rustic tobacco and blowing the smoke into the crown of my head. He began to whistle his icaro and pat me with the shacapa.

The Chief is busting his butt to get ahead of the drug induced crime wave sweeping Hyannis. He's got a new task force of his own out on the street right now. They reportedly made seven arrests their first two days on the job. The Chief has already visited with the local judges so that they understand that the arrests made by this new unit are the bad guys that need to be off the street. I'll tell you more about it next week after the formal announcement. I don't want to steal the Chief's thunder. This is his deal and he deserves all the credit for pulling this team together.

There is no easy solution for changing the fortunes of the Welsh economy. Wales does not have sufficient resources to work alone in attracting inward investment to Wales nor the advantages that UKTI has in terms of resources and networks. We were disappointed that the Business Minister for Wales chose not to give evidence to this inquiry. The Minister's decision was a grave discourtesy to the Committee and to Parliament. The Welsh Government must engage with politicians in the UK Government to maximise opportunities to attract inward investment to Wales and so improve the long-term prospects of the Welsh economy. The UK Government and the Welsh Government must work together effectively, and work with education providers and industry, for the improvement of the Welsh economy and the Welsh people.'

The doctor just came in and told us that she does need to have surgery to correct this, and it needs to happen before next week, or we could be looking at a very severe situation. Problem is, there's nobody at this hospital that can do it laparoscopically, so they'll have to transfer her down to a hospital in downtown Kansas City tomorrow. I'm thinking I'll probably delay my flight home and come back to Austin afterwards, if I can.
Where is your focus? Is your focus on all the bad things or on what God is doing? Are you just looking at the bad things or are you looking for the God opportunities? I love this verse and cling to it a lot because it keeps me focused on where my mind should be - Philippians 4:8 – Finally, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is of good repute, if there is any excellence and if anything worthy of praise, dwell on these things. So where is your focus, on the negative things that happening in life or are you focusing on what God is doing around you and are you looking for and thinking about those positive things?
He helped me up and held me and again we were just quiet together. I cried silent tears into his neck. I yawned and then couldn't stop yawning. He patted me twice and I got up. He brought me to bed undressed me and told me to lay down. I laid on my belly and he didn't cover me. He kissed me pointed the fan on me and went to get ready for bed. When he came back I was already dozing. He laid down and pulled me to him. He whispered to me for a bit. My eyes were so heavy with sleep that I could only mumble a sound here and there when I thought it appropriate. He kissed my eyes. He told me everything was right again. He told me he was going to sleep well because I was back in his arms. He dragged his fingers softly up and down my back. I sighed. He pressed his lips against my forehead and prepared for sleep. I could feel the warm breath coming from his nostrils. Then ever so softly he whispered the most beautiful words against my skin.

Basically, the plot is about a lonely housewife with a desultory sex life. The new hubbie is lovely, but boring. And his bed skills are less than satisfactory. That's the thing when you marry Boy-Next-Door types. You sacrifice the erotic for the safe; the dangerous risk-taker for the trustworthy do-gooder. Anyhow, The Housewife grows bored with vanilla sex and sets out to find something pulsier. That's when she meets The Spanish Guy Who's Still A Virgin. (There's an oxymoron right there). From then on, she proceeds to educate him in – you guessed it – the art of pleasure. To use a ladylike word. There are hotel rooms, orgies, taxi drivers and what one critic described as "erotic, Houellebecqean-style encounters".

A final personal note: I naturally put a yew tree in my walled garden in Park Slope. It’s the only tree I have planted in New York. It grows very slowly but it is indifferent to drought, cold, or the large angry trees around it. It will probably be the only plant I have planted to survive if I abandon my garden.

Sarah Pinborough – Diary Entry #3
I’m not a Catholic, as I previously said, but I am a romantic. The papal visit fills me with a sense of occasion, a sense of history. I fail to see how one could not be moved by the whole thing, unless one had a soul of clay. For the first time in our history, in the history of Christianity itself, the head of the Catholic Church came to our island on an official visit. More than that, he gave a speech in Westminster Hall, in the very place where Thomas More stood trial for his life, holding to a simple principle that there was a higher duty than duty to the state. More, as a Catholic, believed in miracles. Even so he could never have conceived that the miracle of time and of circumstance would bring the successor of Saint Peter to a place where he once stood alone.
Since it is T-Ball the kids only advance one base on a hit. Each kid bats and then they all run around the bases after the last child bats. So what it comes down to basically is which team gets the most outs. An inning can end once there are three outs, but that seldom ever happens. The team we played recorded no outs against us as all of our kids reached base safely. We were able to record two outs against the other team so we consider that a victory! We don't talk about winning and losing to the kids as it is just about having fun for them, but as parents of course we want our team to win and we did! We don't plan on losing either.
Of course, sooner or later, carpet bombing New York City with my resume is going to mean I'll get a job. But when I do, who will take out the trash and sweep the kitchen floor? Who will make the phone calls? Who will go to the post office, stop by the pharmacy, braise the chicken?
As opposed to units 1-3 at Fukushima Daiichi, where the meltdowns occurred, unit 4′s reactor core, like units 5 and 6, was not in operation when the earthquake struck last year. But unlike units 5 and 6, it had recently uploaded highly radioactive spent fuel into its storage pool before the disaster struck.
As I sit at my computer, typing this out, I take a moment to pause, and say aloud the words that I feel are necessary, to start this project. “Hello, blog-world. My name is Michael Leach. (I breathe a deep sigh, preparing myself to say the words that are about to come.) And, I am a shopaholic. (Whew! That wasn’t so bad.)” My desire to shop borders on the edge of being ridiculous. Every time I get a few extra bucks in my pocket, I feel the need to go and purchase something….ANYTHING! The desire to spend money is overwhelming.

You pull out of the station and take an immediate right to begin ascending the first hill. The clickety-clack of Judge is especially beautiful. To the right is an artificial lake and the rest of the park which you can contemplate as you ride to the top, then it's up and over. Two hills and five camelbacks later, you're done. Elegant and absolutely wonderful.

"First, I should say that the point I'm making there is in many ways a critical one, meaning that it's directed at other historians of metal who have tried to pinpoint the origins of the genre. I've never been convinced that metal originated with a set of isolated gestures (such as the two I name, the Kinks 'You Really Got Me' or the sound of Blue Cheer). That's not to say I don't think those earlier things contributed to the formation of metal, but in my understanding, a genre doesn't exist until there's enough of a critical mass of things that all seem related to each other that people start to perceive something to be there that wasn't there before. That critical mass didn't exist in 1965 or 1967 or even arguably in 1969, but to my mind it does start to come more to fruition right at the turn of the 1970s. The fact that the term 'heavy metal' doesn't appear in print in anything like its recognized form until 1970/71 only further proves the point for me. While I don't think one can ever definitively draw a line in the sand and say, this is the date after which metal clearly exists as a genre, I'm of the conviction that most of what precedes 1970 belongs to the prehistory of metal, not to the history of metal proper (but I'd be willing to make some exceptions for things like Led Zeppelin's first couple albums, both released in '69).

No. We have distorted this profound mystery. We have chosen pollutants over purity on more than one occasion. And nights have watched silent tears and God has grieved. Arrogance and folly and horrible decisions have stolen the sweetness of our sexuality and we are left with bruised fruit. And we do not look the part of God’s handiwork. Somehow, someone has scrawled across His masterpiece.

It’s been 40 years to the day — since April 17, 1972, or 14,600 days ago — that Herman Wallace and Albert Woodfox have been held in solitary confinement in Louisiana. The state says they were guilty of murdering a guard at Angola Prison, but Wallace, Woodfox and their network of supporters say they were framed for their political activism as members of the Black Panthers. Woodfox and Wallace founded the Angola chapter of the Black Panther Party in 1971. A third prisoner, Robert King joined them a year later. The three campaigned for better working conditions and racial solidarity between inmates, as well as an end to rape and sexual slavery. Today, to mark the 40-year anniversary of their placement in solitary confinement, Amnesty USA says it will deliver a petition to Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal that bears the signatures of tens of thousands of people from 125 countries. We speak to Robert King who was released in 2001 when his conviction was overturned and he pleaded guilty to a lesser offense. “We want the state of Louisiana, and we want the world to know, that we are still focusing on this case that is a total violation of human rights and civil rights,” King says. “It is ongoing.”

She then laid her hands on the girl's head and blessed her, saying, "Keep God in your heart, and it will go well with you." With that she closed her eyes. When she was laid to rest in the earth, the girl walked behind the coffin crying, and paid her last respects.

Those who are deeply mortgaged into real estate, won’t be soon… either one way or the other. Which do you choose: whether you will be dry or wet when the thunderstorm breaks, when even the people who only worship words will be faced with the God of all words? We can wait until then to know God speechlessly, or just go ahead right now. Be grateful for every single aspect of your life… for so long as you shall live… starting as soon as you choose to stop doing anything else.
Perhaps some reviewers are not so concerned with an authors' feelings but worry rather that a bad review will stop a book selling. This concern is founded on the assumption that anyone reading a bad review will be put off even looking at a book. But it's a breathtaking patronization of readers to assume that they'll swallow wholesale a blogger's views. As some commenters have said, they are often prompted by a bad review to read a book and are not only pleasantly surprised but provoked to write a contradictory, positive review. Susan Hill however has stated that she has noted 'lemming' behaviour among bloggers - I hope she's not right. Someone somewhere during this week's discussion (can't find it at the moment, I'm sorry) quoted an American study which showed that while negative reviews do not push up the sales of books as much as positive reviews, they do nevertheless push them up.

I am realizing more and more the need to take time alone in reflection and prayer. It is in these times that I feel re-energized, re-invigorated, and fully rested. And, not surprisingly, I find myself more in tune with God, more attentive to His will, and more open to the guidance of His Spirit.
These beers, of course, are from Belgium, and represent some incredible breweries and styles. We are going to be pairing these with cheeses made at Sweet Grass Dairy in south Georgia. Not only are the cheeses going to be featured, but the head "cheese" from the dairy is also going to be at this event. He will be there to help educate you guys about cheese making, Georgia cheeses, cows I suppose, and whatever you want to know. These folks are personal friends of our chef, Peter, so it will be a great opportunity for you to mingle with them if you are curious at all about what they do. Peter is going to feature the cheeses creatively in small bites, not just a piece of cheese on a plate. This is not, I repeat, not a beer dinner. This event is going to run from 3:00-5:00pm and consist of those six beers in 4 oz. pours and the six little bites to feature the cheese and compliment each beer. The cost is $30.00 (cheap!), and there will be guys from the importer of these beers on hand to talk about beer (if you are into that kind of thing, and you are). The structure will be loose, with each pairing at stations located throughout The Fred so that you can move around and taste at your own pace. Will have cool beer stuff to give away? Probably. We usually do. No promises though.

The story of my mother is a book all on it’s own. One I could not write because it’s one I couldn’t ever reread…relive. Not just for me. For my sisters. For my nieces. For my nephews. For my son. I cannot relive it all. Because poison kills. I made it threw once…just barely. I wouldn’t take my chances with a second go-around.

Sometimes Arty wondered about the path the world was rolling down. He, and many agents in Population Management believed that eventually their country would be set to rights through their efforts. One day the Death department would be eliminated and even Birth could be downsized, leaving the Life agents to guide the people who were born into the managed world. It had been decades, though, and while a large percentage of the population had accepted the way an had no reason to criticize it, there were those who still committed crimes ranging between minor and atrocious and clung to their right to protest. Their numbers had gone down, but not quickly enough for Arty. He sometimes wished they could be even harsher, get more crimes in the category of assassination so they didn’t have to waste a year on people who were not going to adapt. Trim it down to the contributors, to the parents who wanted to raise kids to be better than those that came before, to the people who could see the reasons behind the system.
Don’t misunderstand me. I’m thankful for all I learned in that suburban cattle stall, which was a lot. Seriously, it was. And I also developed skills I’ll use throughout my life. But in the past month-and-a-half I’ve learned just how depressed I’d become, and how my aquifers of creativity were all but dry. This is a tough situation for me to face, but I trust in my God and my soon-to-be wife to help me recover.

I also hear this woman say, “I miss you like you can’t imagine,” to the man on the other end of the line. I can even see her smile as she whispers words of comfort and security. I smile when I hear her laughter, the soft laughter which I am sure makes that person far away smile dreamily as well. That person far away whom I cannot hear no matter how much of myself I immerse in this little corner in my head. I cannot hear what he says to make her eyes light up like they do at such moments, but I know it must be much more than I can imagine when she tells him, “I don’t have to dream of you; you are my dream.” I wish I can hear those words when I am outside of my head.
I just spent a week at my parents’ place in Wisconsin, and there is nothing like the country to lend perspective on all human endeavors. My city slicker problems melted away as we discussed more relevant matters: Which recycled materials in the basement were going to become a proper chicken coup? How were my brothers and partner going to extract a giant boulder from the middle of the garden? What shape would this year’s deer fence take? What was for dinner?

We lived on the corner of Trigg and 32nd street. The same house, the same friends, the same neighborhood colored every one of my school years. As I got older what I considered entertainment and my motivations changed but looking back I have nothing but fond memories. Yeah I'm lucky to have escaped serious damage to myself or other given some of the crap we did but most of our activities were harmless.

Speaking of Apple, who drinks very similar cool-aide to Qualcomm you have a similar cash and marketable position, about $26 billion. But the two market caps are wildly different. Much has been made of Apples king of the world market cap. Qualcomm comes in at a very pedestrian $100 Billion give or take. An extra $520 million effort less risk free at Apple will not be kicked out of bed. But it just will not have the same impact relatively speaking.

In the prayer we also recognize that our human failings against Love are a major impediment to the fulfillment of His Will and therefore ask for His forgiveness, in accord with our forgiveness of those who trespass against us. In doing this we clear out anything in us that would impede His Will from being accomplished.
The rally is a direct challenge to Najib, who since last year’s crackdown, has launched a campaign to repeal authoritarian laws in a bid to create what he called “the greatest democracy”.
I used the Prayer of St. Francis, which we all are familiar with if for no other reason than having heard the song that was made using the words of this prayer. I have been singing that song ever since I created this card! LOL! Anyway... my card base is Bazzill and is cut with Spellbinders Labels 23 Grand. The prayer is stamped on My Mind's Eye Bella Bella dp. I used Cheery Lynn Exotic Butterflies Small, Versafine Sepia Ink, Martha Stewart bough punch,ZVA Creative small white roses, and the larger pink rose if from the bridal dept. at Micheal's. This was super quick and easy but with the cut shape, it packs quite a punch!

McIntyre and Heath were a blackface team who started out in the golden age of minstrelsy and were still going well into the jazz age. McIntyre played “Alexander” the slow-witted stable boy; Heath played “Hennery”, his pompous friend who tried to put on airs. Their most famous sketch (of many) was called “the Ham Tree” – they rung various changes on it for 50 years. A 1905 full-length version provided W.C. Fields with his first speaking part. Other sketches included “the Georgia Minstrels”, “the Man from Montana”, “Flying to Jail”, “Chickens”, and “Waiting at the Church”.

1) Given the Professor’s exit, I have given up fantasizing about him, even though he is the best lay I have had, he has the biggest dick I have seen, and the very thought of him inside me again makes my knees weak. (Ok… writing this blog has made me re-fantacise). But after the “official broken heart” that I could see coming a mile away, even though I didn’t want to really acknowledge my own intelligence on the matter, fantasies about him have essentially disappeared. Essentially, within one day, my own material withered down to nil.
Then if you have to terminate the employee, it won’t be a shock. And just as important, with a well-organized process, the problem won’t drag on too long and you will have documented the reasons behind your decision.
Either scenario is terrifying. Both scenario’s are almost identical and can be applied to each other. One side believes it is God’s punishment for sin, the other believes it is our punishment for being sheep. Both believe that we can survive and in some cases prevent this from happening. Although I have observed many who plan to let it happen. Who revel in the events eventuality. It would certainly disturb some of you to know, some willingly wish to help these mythical rulers execute this plan. They feel that somehow these monsters will see fit to care for them and lift them from the destruction for their obedience.

earlier this week, i painted an antique refrigerator...brooke rescued this refrigerator before it was headed to the goodwill pile (from her in-laws, so it was a family piece), and she had a vision! we used inspiration from the restoration hardware catalog, and i really kind of just played with washes and finishes until we came to a place that felt right for the piece. i wish you guys could see the rest of the room that this piece is now in...it's really beautiful! brooke has great taste, and i can't wait to show you the piece once she has it all decorated. :)

As we know our Grain Elevators are becoming a scarce fixture on the prairies because of neglect, fire or just being torn down to make room for the new concrete grain silos of the future. It is so heartbreaking to see such an important part of our farming history turn to dust...so it was decided that in memory of these landmarks we would put out a call to folks across Canada to hook a Grain Elevator Rug. Below you will find a small sampling of the rugs created for this show...I apologize for not listing the creator's name...I was madly dashing about trying to take pics before the hoards of hookers came to view them.

I chose a watercolor painting as the object for the audio video project.

On that note, one of my other favorite shows - and perhaps my dark horse nominee for the current best show on TV - is Showtime's Shameless. You want to talk about survival horror? There's a show about what it's really like to live on the lowest rung of society, living from hand to mouth with no room for margin. Being poor does a marvelous job of clarifying your options: living so close to the ground means you can't be picky about opportunities. You have to compromise everything in order to make it from one night to the next.
The past 10 years have been tumultuous for Swindon; going through the pain of administration nearly 10 years ago, suffering a playoff loss to Brighton 8 years ago, becoming the first former Premier League club to drop to the bottom tier of the English football league in 2006, and suffering two Wembley heartbreaks in two years. But this promotion, under a manager who has done so well with a club that was in disarray at the start of the season, tastes all the sweeter after a terrible season that ended under the stewardship of the hapless Paul Hart.

I guess all this struggle started around September?! Anyways, long story cut short – I have been getting etiquette lessons about how I must speak even if I am the frustrated paying customer who gets no resolution to the issue (though after every phone call, get a text message saying issue resolved!!!)
Yet even these ones, stunned silly, cannot help but praise God—perhaps even in spite of themselves. Whatever the case, one thing is for certain: the appropriate response to the action of God’s grace, wherever it is seen, is to praise God and God alone. I can’t imagine there is anything else we can do but give glory to God who gives grace where no grace is deserved, to those who can do nothing to earn it, to those who barely have the strength and the power to even come before God and ask for it. As it is, the man asked Jesus for nothing that day with his mouth—we read none of his words. As it is, Jesus demonstrated God’s grace that day quite apart from the man’s merit. And God deserved all the praise.

It’s looking a bit better since I first started. From bottom to top is rhubarb – one large clump I inherited and three small crowns I put in. Then there’s the ‘soon to be gone’ weed patch – I’m planning to put sweetcorn in there. Next is the new asparagus bed – two rows of 6 plants, varieties Backlim, Darlise and Gijnlim – in 3 years time I’ll be harvesting the first full crop! Then there’s the beans and potatoes.
Indeed, compliance with the certification against forum shopping is separate from, and independent of, the avoidance of forum shopping itself. Thus, there is a difference in the treatment – in terms of imposable sanctions – between failure to comply with the certification requirement and violation of the prohibition against forum shopping. The former is merely a cause for the dismissal, without prejudice, of the complaint or initiatory pleading, while the latter is a ground for summary dismissal thereof and constitutes direct contempt.

Except--my second time in the tanning bed (for only 13 minutes) I ended up looking like a cooked to perfection lobster! I look absolutely ridiculous with skin that looks like it could glow in the dark. With the help of bottles and bottles of after sun aloe lotion, hopefully I will not end up looking like a lizard shedding its skin. And if I am lucky I will have a decent tan before we take off to Aruba and will be able to spend a fabulous time soaking up the sun and lounging by the pool.
“We will also be giving our Test Driver Alexander Rossi his first FP1 run with us in Barcelona and we are all looking forward to giving him the chance to work with us at a full race weekend. He did a good job in Abu Dhabi when we ran him in the young driver test in 2011 and I am sure he will perform well for us on Friday in Spain.”

While we're on the subject of inter-species communication, I hung out with some schooly people last night, my first real socializing since Dragonstar and I returned last week from ARGH. The occasion was a new book group. I've never belonged to a book group. But there was the promise of wine and tasty things to eat, so I figured what the hell.

For my review, Samantha sent me the Polished Silver Necklace. And instantly, I was in love. The quality of this necklace is incredible. One of the neat features of this necklace is actually the chain! Not only is it very light, it's adjustable! I like this because no matter what type of shirt I am wearing, I can match this necklace with it! You can wear it higher up near your collar bones, or lower to pair with a v-neck or low-cut shirt.

Other cases show that after someone has been deported, they often beat Canadian officials back into the country.
I'd say it's rapidly catching up, though, and the experimental stuff, like the hibiscus amber at Dieu de Ciel, is equivalent to the stuff American brewers are doing, with its own direction. Canadian brewers, and particularly Quebecois brewers, explore things with less fear of having the results labeled as "girly beers," and I think that's a very good thing. There seemed to be less of the embrace of the EXtrEme beer, which I also think is a good thing.
As far as pulling out bushes goes, Patrick and I yanked (with the tractor and chains) and dug (with shovels) out all the bushes except for the gardenias, the palm trees, 2 other kinds of trees that I have no idea what they are, and, of course, we didn't touch the stupid, huge clumps of decorative grass. haha
People keep telling me I’m courageous to write about my grief, and perhaps it does take courage to let people see me at my most vulnerable, especially when I remember that the grieving me will be living forever in cyberspace. Even if I find peace or new meaning or happiness, that vulnerable part will still be accessible to anyone with a connection to the internet. But that is a small price to pay to be able to get my message across.

I would argue that Mr Glasman knows considerably more about the peoples which he affiliates himself with; this analysis wholly disregards the inconvenient tribal rather than class-based conflict from which true English hero Alfred the Great emerged as a beacon of English nationhood.
For his gift, we got him a bike. I have been planning on this bike since right after Christmas. Seth loves to take the girls each weekend riding on their bikes, and so I knew that he would love to join them! He even has mentioned to me a few times that he was going to use his birthday money from my parents to get him a bike! But, I had him beat! I think he loved it!!! Now he just has to use that birthday money to get a trailer to go behind the bike to haul all these girls around, and he will be set! I just may have to ask for a bike myself this year!

I'm not usually a recipe follower ( I usually create my own from what looks good in the produce store) except when I publish for the Secret Recipe Club where we are expected to follow our assigned blog's recipe. I have to admit, this some of the ingredients in this recipe was very different from anything I would have usually made. I never cook with wine, and I would never think of adding tomato paste to a sauce. However, I followed Melissa's recipe to the Tee ,and I am glad I did.
I can hardly believe it's been six years since the mailman brought us three tubes of sticks from Ty Ty, Georgia.
This is what it comes to, sometimes. Weak tea, staring at the bottom that is not usually seen. Not usually, in those weeks of Fat Tuesdays. But the tea gets drunk, all the same, because that is all there is in the cup. That, and the memory of strength.

They could have pretended that he would be talking about his new duets album; at least that would have been timely. All he did was ramble on anyway. And this is a good enough impression to be allowed to ramble on like that. The audience was certainly happy to see him. B-

I have a few more boxes to share today. I made four more boxes on Tuesday. I have more free time now since I don't have to go to work for a while. Yay! to that. Now you would think it was a lot of boxes for one day. When you duplicate the same item, it didn't take as much time at all. Plus I had all the embellishment already so each box didn't take much time at all. I forgot to take a picture of the purple box before I sold it. So here are 3 of them.
I've made a very important decision.. are you paying attention? A very important LIFE CHANGING DECISION.
Weakness: Kentucky remains one of the youngest teams in America. Three starters are freshmen and the other two are sophomores. That’s got to keep Coach John Calipari up at night. It didn’t prevent the Wildcats from making it to the Final Four last season, but it’s got to be a concern as this isn’t the same team. If Kentucky’s youth shows at a key moment, it could be a disappointing finish.

It is pantomime season, but if wanting something with a little more substance than your average ‘Oh, yes he is, Oh, no he’s not’ theatre experience, Dion Boucicault’s Arrah-na-Pogue offers all the fun and frolics you could ask for, but with an emotional journey to boot. We went to see the play in the Abbey on Saturday night. Written in 1864, the Abbey theatre held faithful to the script, but the production of the melodrama was modern in its ability to be tongue-in-cheek.

Should you still be an urban rat, like most of us, one can only assume you must be deeply fooked, if not skimp and clueless. Assuming you have a paying job, you can't hope in hell to receive any financial rewards, never mind hold a bank account and use a debit or credit card. Perhaps you've developed the finer art of bartering. Perhaps you're happy to receive indigenous corn, meat and veggies as your reward, provided a few of your black supremacist brothers raised the herds and cultivated the crops free of any agrochemicals and veterinary services.

Anyway today is green day, so today’s focus is about what you can start to live without and reduce resources. As times get tighter and we see the news headlines talking about more job losses, higher cost of living and the lack of mortgage lending, cutting back is on all our minds.
My new best friend turned on me and spread a lie about being bipolar and mentally unstable. So I cut the cord and moved on. Soon I got chubby Because food was the only thing I could turn to. The fat jokes started and a new bully emerged. He stalked me on Facebook and tagged my photos with the word boob and other stuff. I blocked him but he went on in real life. Eventually he moved away and I went into the 10th grade. Everything got worse.

We took a run out to Middle Concho Park today. One of the highlights was catching a photo op of the Great Blue Heron, (Ardea herodias). The Great Blue is I believe my favorite of all of the herons to photograph. This one flew up from the river and lit high in the top of a tree on the other side. I love the way the light breeze was blowing his plumage. He was about 125 yards away.

The worst part them is that she's turning out this amazing stuff EVERY SINGLE DAY. These sort of things aren't like a special Saturday thing, they're constant! There's no getting away from them! Every night at dinner, without fail, there's some sort of calorie-laden desert of awesome . . . awesomeness that's full of awesome, slathered with suburb and drizzled with fantastic. It's all made from scratch. All of it. And it's all FREE! That's the weirdest thing about it all still. There's this desert that you'd see at a bakery or something for some painfully high price, and you probably end up forking over lots of money for them because you KNOW it'll be so good, but the cost sort of helps keep your consumption in check. But not here. Have as much as you want, whenever you want.

“Keep the thought of God’s abundance always in mind. If any other thought comes, replace it with that of God’s abundance and bless that abundance. Give thanks constantly, if need be, that the work is done. Do not go back again to the asking. Just bless and give thanks that the work is done, that God is working in you, that you are receiving that which you desire, for you desire only the good that you may give out the good to all. Let this be in silence and in secret. Pray to your Father in secret, and your Father who sees the secret of your soul will reward you openly.
The media landscape continues to shift as new technologies demand new business strategies, but one thing must remain constant during this transition period: credibility. We understand the company needs flexibility to make decisions quickly, and we have afforded the company that flexibility with a labor agreement that allows the company to change newsroom operations and reduce the workforce. However, the Guild has serious doubts that the decision by management to slash the ranks of copy editors will result in a more efficient newsgathering process. Instead, we believe it will result in a loss of credibility as more mistakes and errors appear in print and online.

Oh, where to start. ”In the unlikely event” that teachers spend time preparing and grading equal to classroom time? Has Levy ever taught a class in his life? Also, university faculty do more than teach; they are expected to do research as well, and it is that research that a) burnishes the reputation of the institution which employs them, which is why those institutions are more than casually interested in someone’s research when they grant him or her tenure, and b) in many cases brings money into Universities to support their growing administrative costs (as Farley also points out, a far bigger factor in college costs than faculty salaries).
It seems to me that one of the most interesting potential effects of open innovation is to shift the balance of importance as between different intellectual property rights. A closed innovation model places the greatest emphasis upon control of intellectual assets by a single proprietor: the exclusionary role of patents for inventions and, to a lesser extent, statutory design monopolies, are valuable tools for achieving this end, as is the role played by contract and general legal principles regarding the protection of trade secrets such as manufacturing know-how. With control of a market secured by such means, the role of the trade mark is relatively small. This is because a trade mark is not generally capable of excluding a product or a technology from the market: all it can do is to prevent its commercial exploitation under a particular name or origin-identifier.
This is a thriller. Tell me what is going to thrill me. The real gut of this story is Collin’s ability to receive premonitions in his sleep and then use them to help or harm others. But that is the very last sentence of the query, which makes me worry that you spend the majority of your manuscript on backstory and descriptions of dreams before finally getting to the point. I need to know what this is about before I’m nearly finished reading it. Then, so that I’m not left thinking, “So?” I need to know why this is a problem for Collin and what he does about it. Are there other threads? Friendships or romances, etc?
Wishing you all a fantastic Monday and the start to a beautiful week!!!

The flip-flop is originally a New Zealand invention, inspired by the Japanese rice straw and wood zori sandals used with kimono. Havaianas follow the original simple, functional design and sometimes feature a small symbol such as the Brazilian flag on the strap. The name Havaianas is Portuguese for Hawaiians.
The Farrelly brothers for absurd, often offensive comedies with enough heart thrown in to usually keep them from collapsing into childish farce. They do not always succeed. Shallow Hal has its flaws, but it perhaps surprisingly hits quite a few marks. It is worth watching if you do not mind not taking a romantic comedy very seriously. Shallow Hal is not a full fledged chick flick.

The influence of the teacher will matter far more than the contents of the article. I think it's a mistake when teachers ask new students why they came, and I think the wise student should prepare a vague and uninformative answer for any such question, as I did before my very first class.
Has there not been a time when you felt alone? You may have felt that all had forsaken you. I want to go back to Acts 16:25, 26 for an example of loneliness. Paul and Silas were in the Philippian gaol.

For rival teams to replicate this system, they will need to find space to package the ducts inside the footwell area. As we saw in 2010, teams can be very imaginative in creating way to package this sort of solution. But this will take time and may explain some team’s opposition to the legality of the system.
Chickweed grows freely here in Tennessee all through winter and into early spring when the tiny white star flowers appear. Some folks think of this invasive weed as a real bother so they spend lots of energy pulling it up just to replace it with another plant which may be no more nutritious or valuable than the chickweed!

There are many problems that arise to a person because of which he has to face a lot of problems for treating them. In this way, there is a problem that mostly happens to kids and they are sometimes habitual to it. The name of that problem is Eczema. It is a problem that happens with a kid due to itching and rubbing on a same part of body for a long time. There is a solution available to most of the people for the problem and that is Cream for Eczema. This cream is available in most of the parts of the world and on many medical shops. Generally, they are of low cost and are affordable from every section of society. Its application can provide relief to the children from the problem which they are facing actually.

What we are seeing here is the beginning of a process – also seen in the changes to Unemployment Insurance in the stimulus – to Federalize the remaining elements of the social welfare state that are run by the individual states, and to establish uniform levels of eligibility and benefit. In other words, Medicaid is the future of single-payer health care in America.
The more I think about it, the more I realize just how scary this really is. We all know that the events of September 11 were carried out by a group of radicals. Civil wars in various nations, over many years, have factions that harbor a little more zeal than the rest of their affiliated groups. But we know that if we take those zealots/ radicals out of the equation, there is general order. The majority of citizens are just trying to get along in the situation they’re in.

In 1997, more than a decade before the 2008 World Financial Crisis speahearded by the collapse of the Lehman Bros in the US, Asia-Pacific was rocked by the Asian Financial Crisis. Back then, I still remember vividly reading in the newspaper of how Thailand's stock market had spiralled out of control, and how shortly, HK's stock market crashed subsequently as well. Thus, started a domino effect, with Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, and Japan all becoming embroiled in the crisis. Of cos, the country affected the most by far, was South Korea. Til then, the economies of the Asia-Pacific had been going strong and growing by admirable figures. Then it all came crashing down with the expose of the failings and weaknesses of the Asian banking and financial sector. There was painful reforms which almost all the Asian economies had to go thru and this is why with the 2008 Financial Crisis, Asian economies were not affected as badly (although still very badly during the worst period in late 08-mid 09 with countries like Singapore and Malaysia slipping into recession) and now rebounding back at an amazingly rapid pace and growing with impressive figures-Singapore, for example, is forecast to grow by over 5% GDP this yr in 2010. Other Asian economies are forecast to have comparable GDP growth rates too.
Hope all my readers and friends had a great long weekend... we ended up going to Canada on Saturday, and on the way up the river was super high, and the white water rafting was going strong. By the time we got back from Canada, around dusk, the rafting had stopped and people were camping and having major cookouts. I was starved, and so wanted to stop and ask them for a burger, lol!

This is the most recent addition. Mindy Gledhill is a recording artist who I believe was affiliated with Deseret Book for a time. If you have the "Trek: A Nashville Tribute to the Pioneers" she performs two songs on that album. She performs "Emma" from the album "Joseph: A Nashville Tribute to Joseph Smith". She has also sung on the album "Baby Mine" produced by Scott Wiley full of lullabye and bedtime songs for children. Her two solo albums are "The Sum of All Grace" and "Feather In the Wind". I really like Mindy Gledhill, and while I enjoyed her second album, "The Sum of All Grace" happens to be my favorite, and I listen to it often. She blogs about her life, her kids, her music, everything. It's a fairly new blog.
Interestingly Scottish Green co-convener Patrick Harvie said:
The weekend went by too fast, but it was a great time that Mom and I spent exploring the city. We never ate at the same place twice and walked off any food we consumed with the multiple mile walks we did. Come visit again soon!
Well, there was definitely no dining going on here. This was actually the cleanest spot (if you can call it that) in the whole place. Turns out my cousin had been cleaning here because that’s where all his dad’s stuff and the games were stored. Sitting at the back of the room was an old metal workshop desk which weighed about 400 pounds and I was lucky enough to get to take all the way to the dumpster. This apartment is on the second floor…

Tim Morton and I are currently forging together our respective positions. Where this will lead, I don’t know and I think Tim provides structural reasons as to why I can’t know in advance where it will lead. Right now I’m tentatively thinking of my own position as something akin to an eco-Marxism. Eco-Marxism wouldn’t simply be a Marxism that takes into account “the environment”, but rather would significantly expand the domain of Marxist thought. On the one hand, eco-Marxism would include nonhuman actors such as animal, mineral, and quantum beings within its scope. Put differently, the index wouldn’t simply be to human emancipation. I’m still thinking through this. On the other hand, drawing on Morton’s concept of the mesh, such a Marxism would focus on the imbrication of humans with all sorts of other media (in McLuhan’s sense) generating local manifestations that prevent us from strictly dividing the human from the nonhuman (think of Latour’s and Stengers’ networks or Deleuze and Guattari’s machinic assemblages). While this aspect of eco-Marxism would be thoroughly relational in character, it would emphasize that relations are always relations of exteriority. In other words, no entity can be reduced to its relations and the local manifestations it produces, but rather every entity harbors within it a withdrawn being in excess of its local manifestations (this approaches the diachronic dimension of Tim’s thought). This withdrawn dimension is the promise of forming collectives otherwise. Where an internalism of relations tends to lead to the conclusion that we’re stuck because all terms are caught in reciprocal relations with one another, the exteriority of relations gives us the resources for thinking change. Here the focus is not so much on critique, but rather, as Latour puts it, composition. That is, the work of politics and ethics is the composition of new collectives of humans and nonhumans opening the possibility of new ways of living. That’s just where my thought is leading. Tim might very well be on a different page.

Later in the year we’d return to the frog pond and there would be tiny froglets everywhere on land. As we trudged through the grass – usually following a rabbit path – it’s hard to say how many we ended up treading on but over the years I bet I’ve killed hundreds although never deliberately; I wasn’t that kind of kid. The atmosphere was always a bit different once the frogs were out and about. I always found the place a bit creepy then as if I was outnumbered, which I was, by thousands to one, but I couldn’t say that I was afraid, not in any real sense (they weren’t interested in us in the slightest) although there was a . . . I’m going to go with ‘potentiality’ . . . a potentiality in the air, a sense that something might happen. Put it this way, when I read what Heaney wrote in ‘Omphalos’:
Next in the series: choosing the "floor" of the garden. Wishing everyone a lovely weekend and as always, thank you for visiting!
Thinking back, that’s exactly what this kupiah-wearing snake did. I should have been more wary and suspicious of people instead of being so trusting; and had I known about these characteristics, I surely would have. This unpleasant encounter seemed to confirm my earlier concerns about stepping out of the shadows and rejoining society.
As I wander down the path of life, instead of viewing the Golden Gates far down the road, I have the ability to experience and enjoy life while I am fit, able and full of energy, so I can look back and know I tried everything I wanted to at the time.
A and B showed up to sign the lease and pay the deposit, and I got my first interaction with B – and I was not happy. She didn’t do anything in particular, but she was pretty rude and demanding toward me, and if she had shown up to fill out the applications I knew I wouldn’t have considered them. How a person treats you at the first showing really says a lot about how the relationship will go, I can go back to almost each and every eviction we’ve had and point things out that I should have picked up on, and I knew she’d be trouble. But we put in that clause in our lease and we had already approved them – so at that point we just had to move forward.
Congrats to all the winners and a HUGE thank you to all the wonderful sponsors!

Correspondingly, if you talk about ideas that may or may not have merit, but still evoke the same kinds of emotion, you get in even bigger trouble. Such is the position that Larry Summers found himself in a couple years ago. He spoke about the reasons that women are underrepresented relative to the population-at-large in tenure-track faculty positions in the sciences. Famously, one reason he gave was the possibility that there are "innate differences" between men and women. He explicitly said what he meant by this: even if the mean aptitude of men and women were the same, if the variance in the male population is greater than the variance in the female population then there will be more men at the extremes (both high and low). Since faculty are drawn exclusively from one extreme, men would be overrepresented.
Each character is flawed and deeply developed through the four seasons; they model how to push through problems and meet one another with tough love. No one is spared humiliation or failure. There are wise souls in the hamlet, and there are fools. Likewise, you will find the same mix in Candleford, as in all places. When the hamlet and town folk meet, class distinctions and prejudice surface. Society’s rules get challenged. Neighbors help neighbors at home, and between town and hamlet; they hurt them too. They live Rumi’s advice: “Be generous and grateful. Confess when you’re not" (from his poem "The Well"). And then like the old Jerome Kern song says, they pick themselves up, dust themselves off, and start all over again.

I believe success should not be determined by the speed with which we move. Eating more doesn’t make the dish more delicious. Getting angry over traffic doesn’t make it move faster. How about learning to stay calm, enjoy life and make use of it in a more meaningful way? By simplifying our life and getting rid of the speediness, we can focus more on human relations and start to appreciate the meaning of life. Calmness and deliberation are also the key aspects to decision-makings. By carefully identifying and weighing alternatives, we are more inclined to make better decisions in business and in our own life.

Polemic fiction has a long and honored -- and sometimes dishonored (Atlas Shrugged by wackjob Ayn Rand comes to mind) -- history in the literary world. In the long run it's very hard to pull off with any finesse. And that is why I was pleasantly surprised with this book. The author has a definite point of view and he's not afraid of making it known, but not at the expense of story and character.

Beat the butter on medium speed for one minute. Add the granulated sugar and beat for three minutes. It will be very light and fluffy. Scrape down the bowl, add the brown sugar, and beat for two more minutes. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating for one minute after each. Mix in the vanilla. Add the flour alternately with the sour cream. Scrape down the bowl once more, and give it a final few seconds to fully combine.

The reason for the polygraph test invitation was that Makhanya made comments after my firing that were simply not true. He invented a meeting I had with him in his imagination and told journalists eager for a bit of juicy gossip that I told him I believed what I had written in the column and that I thought blacks were “indolent savages”. That never happened as Makhanya knows but all he needs to do if he thinks I am wrong and he is right is to take up my invitation of a polygraph test. It may not be admissible evidence in court but it would be interesting to see the result. I don't have any problem with it so why does he?

This ‘digital short’ consists of (at least, according to Brian of the washing machine post) the final chapters that never made it into How I Won The Yellow Jumper. If you’ve read Yellow Jumper, then the style is familiar, and so is the general approach: events from the race are woven together with sideways observations on the mundane, behind-the-scenes life of the Tour. The text is punctuated with pictures, as in Yellow Jumper: happily, you can actually see them clearly this time, thanks to the ebook format.
On my first day I was shown into the room of the then Principal Administrative Officer of the Town Clerk’s Department in which I was to forge my career. (The Town Clerk's Department was the legal department and serviced the political machine ie the elected council.) I can recall his words as if they had been uttered yesterday. “You have joined The Town Clerk’s Department of Liverpool Corporation. The Department will train you. You will be sent to University. You will receive promotions as befit your ability and application to the job. You will have a job for life. In return you have to remember one thing and one thing only. Your job is the same as the job of every one of the thirty thousand employees in the Corporation. Your job is to serve the public. Remember that above all else." And he meant it. Whatever else most people I worked with thought about their job most truly believed that they were serving the best interests of the public of Liverpool.

One day, an evil sorcerer disguised himself as a poor boy. He told the girl that his mother was sick, and he didn’t know what to do. The girl said “I’ll get you a fruit and you can use its power to heal your mother.” The girl climbed the tree, got one fruit, went back down, and gave it to the boy. In an instant, the boy changed into an evil sorcerer. “Hahahaha,” he said, his evil laugh resonating throughout the woods, “I have tricked you. Now I will become the most powerful sorcerer on earth!” He took a bite from the fruit, and he turned into a really good boy.

Of course, there's nothing wrong whatsoever with reading purely for entertainment. But it's interesting that Isobel Akenhead says that sales of 'women's fiction' have dropped off generally.

Our policy in Central and South America under this administration has been abysmal.

Chavez and Castro and Obama sided against the people of Honduras.

But for today, for this weekend, transitory happiness was found in these yellow split peas.
It was this general state of fear and loathing that led me to regard my own children's adolescence with apprehension—even before they had been conceived. MJ recently uncovered a piece of paper that apparently dates back to the early years of my relationship with Frank. On it, I had listed the pros and cons of having kids, and the teenager thing made the Cons list (one of the few cons I, as a rabid kid-lover, had been able to come up with). Needless to say, we carried on with the baby-making even with the dreaded horrors of puberty looming ahead. MJ arrived in all her glory and I was thrilled.
So we have memories of kohl rabi, prepared and dressed up as many ways possible that our poor frazzled mother could think of –Asian-style: kohl rabi stir-fried and braised with slices of beef , chicken or pork with abit of soy sauce or kohl rabi in a meat based soup stock with rice or noodles on the side. Ok, maybe there weren’t that many dish variations after all.
A school is charged with attempting to "educate" hundreds of students to essentially the same level of competence in numerous arcane subjects. To do so while attempting to ensure that children "learn" is a near impossibility, unless the system is set up with rigid controls to cycle through the most people possible - which means that the entire system is set up to deliver to the least common denominator with the least amount of disruption. To combat this and reach maximum efficiency, a school district will resort to virtually any means possible to ensure that students sit still, pay attention, and "learn." Take this recent situation, for example; several states have banned the wearing of Silly Bandz Bracelets in their schools, because of the "distraction" it presents, which limits learning:
Stinging nettle is also loaded with vitamins and minerals. You just pick off the tops anytime before they get more than a foot tall. We have lots of them growing here. Make sure you were gloves though. Once the nettle is cooked it loses it sting. This I just boil in salt water and use like spinach in quiches or whatever hot dish I make. If I am making soup I just add it in fresh if I have it fresh. I also save the water that I boil it in and use it in tea.
Having re-read this grilling of Cameron by Sopel – irrespective of the fact that i am supposed to be ‘socialist’… Cameron worries me. Nothing seems to be structured, coherent, thought out. This is not really good enough for a prospective prime minister who has had some years to work things out. Waffle just doesn’t cut it in tutorials with first year students… it certainly doesn’t when it comes to policy statements from a man who puts himself forward as the next prime minister. Kenneth Clarke? too late for a Conservative leadership challenge?
Well, Honey has a ton of antibacterial and healing properties that is great for acne and sensitive skin. It also helps your skin get back its natural pH and acidity.Many people have been using Honey for wounds and burns and they just apply it to the skin and leave it on the wound for several hours. To use Honey as a wash, I simply take a teaspoon of honey and rub it all over my face. I pay special attention to my trouble areas and then I let it sit for a minute and the I rinse with warm water. Make sure to use raw or natural honey...and not honey flavored syrup!!! If you are looking for some extra exfoliation try baking soda or brown sugar to the mix. I usually add about a half of a teaspoon. It is so delightful and I still can not believe how well it works!!!

It sounds radical, but in terms of knowledge and learning, I don’t think it is really incredibly radical to say that schools are not as necessary as they used to be- but then the way that they are necessary will continue to be valid until society changes dramatically in other, economic, ways.People need their kids to be in school because they are working.So it’s hard to imagine a world without school before imagining a world in which jobs have been dramatically restructured.

Throughout viewing Golia's exhibition, I kept thinking of all the reasons that I was disappointed, of the fine line between expectations and the financial and physical ability (according to conditions) of an artist to live up to their dreams. I thought perhaps it was a Gagosian problem. Golia had the smallest gallery in the house and was limited in what he could do. Perhaps it was a money problem. Perhaps it was a Golia problem, perhaps the myth outgrows the man at the moment. It is difficult to know.

Mati, the Tygrine Cat, exploded on to the children's book scene a few years ago, whiskers twitching, tail lashing, golden eyes aflame. And now he's back, in Inbali Iserlis' sequel The Tygrine Cat on the Run (Walker Books). I must admit a prejudice favour of this magnificent animal and his stories: Mati is an Abyssinian and I've had two of those. Sadly both my handsome boys had short lives but I can still appreciate such a fine figure of a cat.

The Greek result was no more of a surprise than the French one but is is a wilder card event. At the moment, it looks as though a coalition can be formed, but how long a new government could survive isn’t clear. The Greek people have spoken, but only to say they are disillusioned and angry. My bet for today is that the US, having sold risk off after payrolls that were soft but not soft to change anything, will bounce. If that happens, we will have an edgy day in which ranges hold. The catalyst for a decisive move lower by the euro remains absent, though the move is inevitable eventually.

BG: There are a couple of obvious things, I suppose. Most of the stories in Walking the Labyrinth were set in the south Wales valleys, and many of them explored issues around Welsh identity and culture. Only a few of the stories in Blindfold have valleys settings – though some of them are set in Cardiff – and there’s less of an attempt to explore those issues specific to post-industrial south Wales, for want of a better phrase. Many of the stories in this new collection are set elsewhere, or often have non-specific, sometimes vaguely surreal, settings. I’m really not sure why that should be the case, to be honest. Perhaps I felt I’d worked through some of those specific cultural issues in the previous collection, though it certainly wasn’t a conscious decision.
So what are the alternatives to direct questioning?

At dusk the rain started. Tropical torrents accompanied by sky shattering thunder claps. Conversation grew hushed. We wrapped the children in spare towels to keep them warm and tried to move them out of the worst of the weather. With the wind gusting our candles sizzled out and our only light was an eerie pirouetting beam from a torch dangling from the roof of our shelter. As the light danced around picking faces out of the gloom I felt encouraged - here was a bunch of people from many countries who didn't know each other. We were cold, we were wet, we didn't know what was coming, but we were smiling and helping each other. I'm sure the tentions would have arisen had we been there for days rather than hours - but as a stranger gave a yogurt to a tired child or offered the use of a phone to a family there was an element of Blitz Spirit to be proud of.
OPTION 1: Breakdown/Separation of Fellowship
Do we understand what Christ did for us? Philippians 2:8 (NASB) “Being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.” When that verse speaks of Jesus humbling Himself it means that He did not have to leave His position of glory that He held in Heaven with the Father. But he came down as a simple man, a carpenter, and walked this earth in poverty and strife. He allowed others to abuse Him and mock Him. He was sentenced to die without even a real charge against Him that was true. Yet He did not fight back. He could have. In the account of His arrest in Matthew He stated that if He wanted He could summon up more than twelve legions of angels to fight for Him. But He sacrificed His own glory, His reputation, and was “obedient” to the point of death.

Gameplay is easy to learn as you can opt to have in-game hints, or step up to the challenge with minimal aid. Combat is stress-inducing as weapons are obviously scarce, requiring Alan Wake-like concocting on the fly. Strategy comes into play as you rid of walker scum with caution not to turn a stealthy kill of one into a manic killing of a swarm. But make sure you are quick with your button pushing. A sluggish reaction to the real-time button input, and you’re zombie meat. I was a bit too slow in one of my game-changing decisions (each choice you make, whether in combat or conversation, alters the episode) and the whole fleet succumbed. It definitely keeps you on your toes.

It wasn’t the best of days. I found myself a little more fragile and high-strung than I had set out to be. It seemed like everywhere I went today there was a new baby unwittingly flaunted in front of me. The disgruntled newborn in Target this evening nearly sent me over the edge. It was that distinct cry of an infant… only days, maybe weeks old. The tears involuntarily welled up in my eyes as I quickened my pace away from the sound and frantically tried to remember what I had even come there for. The new layout of the store wasn’t making things any easier on me as I accidentally wound up in a maze of bottles and receiving blankets… cute little pink booties and baby rattles sneered at me. Is this how it’s going to be? Am I just a time bomb ready to detonate at any given second?
What are we if we don’t strive to be like God above?
One of my goals for this month is to transform my craft room into a functional and attractive space that I enjoy spending time in. It's currently mostly a dumping ground for my crafting supplies. This means that there are no usable work surfaces, that it's hard to find something when I need it, and that it's not a space I enjoy using. This is what it looked like after the holiday craziness.
One of the more interesting, unusual and unheralded programs to deal with this problem began in the spring of 1977. As detailed in a New York Times article dated April 7, 1977 by Judy Klemesrud, Cardinal Terence Cooke, speaking to parents at Holy Cross School on 8th Avenue and 43rd Street denounced the spread of pornography and called on all Catholics to demonstrate publicly against pornography in Hell’s Kitchen and to picket some of the more notorious pornographic establishments. This in many ways was an amazing and unprecedented request. While there may have been demonstrations against pornography in places like Tipton Iowa, or perhaps even conservative areas of Queens, public anti-pornography demonstrations a block from Times Square by residents of Hell’s Kitchen were unheard of. Times Square going back to the days of the Tenderloin was always a risqué area. Furthermore, given the brazen nature of many of these prostitutes and their pimps there was potentially a fair amount of physical danger to anti-pornography demonstrators confronting them on the streets. In addition, it was widely believed that the mafia (actually the Colombo crime family) was a partner in many of the porno establishments, and it was unclear what they might do against demonstrations that directly affected their economic interests. Also public demonstrations were more commonly tactics of anti-war groups, not the Catholic Church or Tammany Hall political clubs (although the idea may have come from the tactics of such groups).
The Characters:
It’s just as well that Obama is secure enough in his sexuality not to blast the poster to kingdom come with a Cruise missile. He’s recently been proving his heterosexual credentials by canoodling with Julia Gillard, the raunchy redhead who rules the roost in Australia. After greeting Ms Gillard with a moist-looking peck on the cheek, he patted her receptive tush right into the White House. I hope Michelle was mature enough not to give him hell afterwards – there’s no such thing as cheating when you’re making political alliances.
I'm over-the-moon-excited to go to the Women of Faith conference this weekend!
4) Research the little people. Did you ever think to sit down and find information on all the people involved in Star Wars, whom you had no idea about? Do you have any idea how many people work with/for Lucasfilm? From video games, to books, to comics, to marketing and ‘fan outreach’. Star Wars is more than just George Lucas – it’s George Lucas and his peeps!

The Year 2009 will be remembered as a notoriously historic year. What a wild ride the economy took us all on! In spite of the Recession, things were jumping here at the tent.

He also spends a bit of time attacking the tired notion that when rich people get richer they create jobs:
I didn't change anything except for the amount of egg white and the bitters. I went back to the original amount for the egg white and found that such a small amount is exactly what this cocktail needs. While it wasn't as pretty as the last--the color was not as rich and no real foam appeared--it did not separate. The smell and taste were very similar to that above. I did replace the orange bitters with aromatic on the fly, which was a welcome addition. The spiciness came through on the aftertaste and really brought the idea of the Manhattan to the forefront. The texture was still creamy and smooth, though less so, as expected. All in all, a worthwhile experiment, with a very tasty cocktail at experiment's end. Now I feel like Mr. Baker's words will work: "This is another one to watch cannily lest our pedal extremities fold up at some totally inappropriate moment." Indeed!

Is a HUG so bad!…(smiling)…If you have this awesome person hugging you for whatever the reason then what could be better? People tell me that it is a female thing-ok I am a female! And with a nice mans arms wrapped arround me will you still say “oh its a female thing”? After all if I was not a REDHEADED female who has your attention and obviously you would be someone who has mine-why would we not be hugging? So just HUG me and don’t talk…..
So while the game may not be quite as good as its predecessor and definitely falls in the “more of the same” category, Naughty Dog still manages to deliver an excellent action-adventure game. With great characters and story, epic set piece moments, jaw-dropping graphics and robust multi-player options this is one game that any PS3 owner shouldn’t hesitate to check out.

I have been hoping and hoping that Babby would turn into a thumb sucker, but it just doesn’t seem to be happening. So I am still his nighttime soother and this results in him needing to nurse every time he wakes up. I know perfectly well that he’s not actually hungry, but he screams like a banshee without it. The author explains that Babby’s sleep association with booba is so strong that he thinks he NEEDS it to go back to sleep, which is a problem because people naturally wake up every couple of hours. Most of us just roll over and go back to sleep, but if you think you need a booba in order to sleep, you might get upset. She has some tips on how to wean him off of booba, namely popping the booba out of his mouth as soon as he starts to fall asleep, so the association at least doesn’t get any stronger.

FIVE BLOGS THAT ARE ‘LIEBSTER’ TO ME…
I wish I could find the words to write about how I feel. Writing has always been my outlet, my way of sorting out my thoughts and figuring out my feelings. But it's just not working this time. Something's different. I feel lost, and I can't seem to find my way back. I hate this.
The greater Chittagong area including Cox’s Bazar was under the rule of Arakan Kings from the early 9th century till its conquest by the Mughals in 1666 AD. When the Mughal Prince Shah Shuja was passing through the hilly terrain of the present day Cox’s Bazar on his way to Arakan, he was attracted to the scenic and captivating beauty of the place. He commanded his forces to camp there. His retinue of one thousand palanquins stopped there for some time. A place named Dulahazara, meaning “one thousand palanquins”, still exists in the area. After the Mughals, the place came under the control of the Tipras and the Arakanese, followed by the Portuguese and then the British.
Not everyone is for everyone. I was reminded of this recently when I reached out to a friend of a friend for the second time and was—I now understand—rejected.

By far the biggest of these, for my money, is France. Having failed to get a shovel into either the EFSF or the ECB, and having watched as the world showed zero interest in the leveraging bazooka, all they’ve done over the last three weeks is sink deeper into the doo-doo. I remain of the view – first expressed here following the EFSF rows leading up to the GdF – that if the Gallic banking fall-over can be contained, this suits Berlin perfectly. France can bail out its banks and remain afloat, but it’ll have taken one mother of a torpedo amidships. This will relegate Sarkozy’s country to the second rank, and force her to do Germany’s bidding. But if the ship sinks, then Germany’s plans are, basically, ruined. So my prediction is that, when push comes to shove, Berlin will keep Paris afloat. What it won’t do is buy the French a new engine. (I think the rumours about a north-south Europe divide reflect another of the options being held in reserve, just in case the Sorbonniers throw all their toys out of the pram.)

Breakfast was another heavy affair – I keep on talking about ‘feasting’ because at Mountain Trail, they fed us really well. Every meal exceeded our expectations. The variety, quantity, and quality of food was value for money – it didn’t seem that pricey either.
Sure, I will freely admit that I think it's good for our national consciousness to have this terrorist eliminated. We've been dragging around this heavy weight for the last ten years; pushing the search for Bin Laden to the back of our minds, and trying the forget that he was the reason we removed the Taliban, bombed and killed hundreds, if not thousands, of civilians in Afghanistan, and somehow tried to legitimize our attack and occupation of Iraq because of either the ties to Bin Laden and Al Qaeda, or because we were worried that Saddam Hussein was going to become another terrorist (I could never exactly figure out their excuse - I don't think I'm alone on this one). Now, at last, the dark cloud has parted, and we can finally say - as a country - that we killed the man responsible for the attacks on the World Trade Center. It is sort of a national catharsis that I think we're in desperate need of, and I think it actually might have an amazing effect on our economy, the salty political discourse, as well as our foreign policy.

But then, if our goal is harm prevention, why should we wait until the harm has been caused before intervening? In other words, why doesn’t the following argument hold?

Let us now consider some of the tactics the papacy is using to subvert the United States. Just because they call themselves a church does not mean that they are honest or honorable. Remember that Satan, the devil, gave the papacy their power and great authority (Revelation 13:2). The Catholics, through their Jesuits, are working to accomplish the exact opposite from what the Catholic Church claims they stand for. For instance, the church claims to be against abortion, but their Jesuits, working in secrecy and masquerading as regular citizens in the government, work to pass laws and make judicial rulings permitting abortion. They have their right hand fighting their left hand to thoroughly confuse the people of the United States and to keep the people from ever connecting this evil conspiracy with them. Here is another example. The pope gets on television and, acting very piously, prays for peace, while his Jesuits are behind the scenes stirring up all kinds of wars, conflicts and terrorism in the world.
One of the things that we learned most while in our photography program is that none of us shoots like the other. We can go into a shoot… stand right next to one another and aim and shoot the exact same subject, but come out with completely different images to work with. Not one photographer wants to shoot like another. We may have the same tastes in style but our photographs are as different as our signatures.

I loved watching my brothers play football when they were in college and I think athletics was our therapy while we grieved for our dad. One of my brothers is still very close friends with several of his teammates from SMU. I have just recently reconnected with some of the girls I played sports with. Our bodies are broken and we feel old injuries from the past but in our minds, we can run as fast as we ever did. Hiking is my new sport and the travel to new locations, the distance or altitude of a hike is my new challenge. It’s still a team sport in a way. I always have a friend to share it with and there is something about walking with someone who opens the mind and heart and soon inhibitions slip away to encourage meaningful and therapeutic conversation.
Refrigerate the hearts for about 2 hours or place in your freezer for 10 minutes. I usually do the freezer method, but I've been having problems with the chocolate coating cracking, so this time I chilled them in the refrigerator and there was no cracking! Definitely make certain they are nicely chilled before attempting to add the sticks.
The catch is some of the technology needed to build Corona doesn’t exist. But that’s changing. Recently, researchers and chip makers have shrunk optical communications devices so that they can be put onto chips. They’ve made chip-scale equivalents of cables, modulators, and detectors. “A lot of people have concentrated on individual devices,” said HP’s Fiorentino. “Now they’re starting to build circuits. It’s like going from the transistor to the integrated circuit.”

It is critically important that you keep this file protected as well as your private key. If this revoke were to fall in the wrong hands, someone else could publish it to public servers and revoke your certificate without your knowledge. You should store a copy of your private key and a certificate revoke snippet offline on a removable drive and store it in a safe place. The best scenario is to throw the private key and revoke package into an encrypted file system on a thumb drive, and chuck that into a fire-proof safe.
With pressure mounting, I completely cracked and even broke down in front of my boss. When you are under a kind of stress that is practically unknown to 98% of the population, it is very hard to find people to relate too. And course, I had not yet competed, so I hadn’t really made any “fitness friends” that I could go to for support. I was tired, cranky and lacked motivation. My hormones weren’t helping either as I had discovered through my extensive research that women who were on birth control would hang on to excess fat due to the high levels of estrogen present in the “pill”. After nearly ten years, I quit the pill cold turkey.

‘In these poems, Mozart rubs shoulders with Hesiod, Cranach with Picabia, Nietzsche with Fitzgerald, Rodin with Rochegrosse. But what animates this first full collection is the constant and beguiling presence of the central character - arch-flâneur, would-be mauvais garçon, Lincolnshire small-town escapee, irreverent scholar - picking his way through these crowded streets, savouring his impressions of all that he encounters and inviting the reader to join him.

Straight-up it’s a simple point about unity despite variety. That phrase can be misused to dress up a mishmash of theological heterodoxy that’s actually got about as much unity as a joint Apple & Android staff team-building day. But in context here it captures the stunning and intentional variety of the one God lovingly manifesting himself in his people through various gifts.

Since people infected with HIV generally do not exhibit any symptoms until they get sick from opportunistic infections, everyone should be tested for HIV on a regular basis. In NCTE and the Task Force’s survey, almost 10% of the respondents indicated that they did not know their HIV status. Usually, HIV tests require a blood sample but some tests use urine or saliva instead. Some tests take a few days for results, but rapid HIV tests can provide results in approximately 20 minutes.

Tears and grief were uncontrollable as Dickie fell to his knees between the tracks. He nudged Splasher and the only motion was that initiated by his urging. He had only heard about death now he felt its thrust. He wept and sobbed. He could not move. He didn’t want to move. He thought his presence would somehow bring him back to life. A flood a memories rushed in on him; running, wrestling, jumping, petting, and chasing – all the things a boy does with his dog.

But as I am sure that would (probably not) bore me at some point, I believe (c) I'd love to meet someone who could make me laugh and make me see things in a different light. Sometimes life seems monotonous and I would imagine longevity would make it worse, so meeting someone who truly sees life for what it could be and brings that to others, that's what I would love to see.
We had another fun day at homeschool soccer today. Nathan was not there so I was not able to get as many photos as I would have liked to.

They all look at me like I must be crazy. Ha ha.

In the last couple of years I’ve dedicated myself to teaching belly dance to others and sharing what I know. It also entailed owning and running a belly dance studio which, running any business, takes all of one’s time. Unfortunately, performance opportunities were few and far between in Mississippi and so I’ve felt a little rusty in the performance aspect of my belly dance career. This is where my Snohomish performance comes in. While there are sometimes events in Bellingham to perform at, I wanted to get out of town to be able to perform and meet more dancers from the Seattle area.

Preheat oven to 375. While oven heats, spray the bottom and sides of pie dish with non-stick cooking spray. Then spread refried beans on the tortilla and put the tortilla (bean side up) into the baking dish. Next sprinkle half of the cheese over the beans. In a bowl combine the milk, eggs and the rest of the cheese and whisk together until well combined. Then mix in the chopped spinach and stir to combine. The spinach should be cut into large bite size pieces. Next pour the entire egg mixture over the tortilla and beans and bakes in the 375 degree oven for 18 minutes. After 18 minutes, turn the oven up to 425 and bake for an additional 5-7 minutes or until it is golden brown and puffed up a bit.

The strength of this view is that it is very broad and speaks to the general principle that God does not want His people to marry people who don’t believe in Him. Certainly, that point is being made here. The weakness of this view (I think) is that it’s not quite specific enough to deal with what seems to be happening here. God seems very upset about this event, there’s got to be more going on here…

I have to say, it wasn't all that bad. He offered up his seat at the bar, like a true gentleman and flagged the bar tender over to take my drink order. Paid for my beverage. When our table was ready, he took out my seat and ordered a fantastic bottle of wine to go with dinner. The conversation was relaxed and easy, and then I made a joke. The laugh that came from the person sitting in front of me made me want to run for the high hills! I was not only loud, but had this quality of being high pitched, nasal'y and throat'y all at the same time. I was literally the kind of laugh that makes you cringe from the inside-out. I nervously chuckled, looked around the room to see that people's heads had actually turned and realized that this extreme laugh would take this guy down a long road of lonely unhappiness.

In the 50 years since oil was discovered in Nigeria, over $400 billion have been realised as revenue but the money has been stolen by the politicians and the corrupt civil servants leaving Nigerians to fend for themselves. The evil genius Abacha and his family were able to bank $4 billion of these monies in Switzerland, Jersey Island, New York, Australia, France and Britain. The story is no different in Angola, Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, DRC, Guinea, Chad, Zambia, Sudan, Liberia, Ivory Coast, Egypt, Algeria, Sierra Leone and Gabon where oil, gas, gold, diamond, copper and other valuable minerals have brought in billions of dollars yet most the people live in abject poverty. The people are poor because the Slave Masters have decided they should remain so, as monies meant for their development have been stolen and are sitting in UBS, Credit Suisse, Barclays bank, BNP, Crédit Lyonnais and Citibank.
Last Sunday at Mass I was confronted with the above question. As it happened it was a day when I was in quite a bit of physical pain. The pain didn’t start out to be really bad. I would be all right walking to church, so I thought. But far from it. After walking the distance, which took about twenty-five minutes, the pain was getting quite considerable. I arrived at the church at the last minute. But Father was still standing there shaking hands. He shook my hand too.

So, that is a review. Let's talk about the negative "reviews" that authors have been lashing out at. They often involve animated gifs, swearing, and snark. They're often quite funny. But here's the thing, though. When a blogger writes a biased, hilarious, snarky rundown of a book they despised, he/ she is not writing a review. They are writing a post about a book. I'm not saying that bloggers shouldn't write biased, hilarious, snarky rundowns of books. I'm saying that those rundowns are not reviews. Bloggers who regularly write them cannot expect to garner the same respect and treatment from authors that pro reviewers or non-pro reviewers do. They can't expect authors to read their posts and learn something from them. And they cannot expect authors to not take it personally. They've made it personal.
The MVD (Motor Vehicle Division) in Surprise is every bit as obnoxious as the DMV (Department of Motor Vehicles) in Idaho. They hire vicious, surly folks there. (Excuse me if any of you work at such a place but it is true, and you know it.)
This past weekend I joined an anthropology class in a field trip to the ruins of Volubilis, a Roman-occupied city inhabited by native Moroccans that is at least 2000 years old. The ruins were amazing, and we got a good feel for how people used to live; the largest houses were something out of a Hollywood movie, with giant courtyards and fountains. Among the residences, a Roman bath house, triumphal arch, forum, and basilica still stand today. After the ruins we ate lunch in Moulay Idriss, the nearest town which is built into the mountains lining the valley. It is not so dissimilar to Chefchaouen, except is only an hour away, so some of us were thinking about spending the weekend there for hiking and camping. It’s by far the least touristy city I’ve seen in Morocco.

Society doesn’t teach us to communicate effectively any more. Notice I said effectively as people communicate more now as opposed to any other time in our past. It’s the manner in which they communicate that creates a problem. People would rather send a text than pick up the phone or read an update on Facebook rather than ask you how your day went. I am guilty of this myself in many ways. I text and use Facebook and there is nothing wrong with that, but developing good communication skills is an integral part of building relationships. Since making sales depends on building long and short term relationships and since everything in life is a sale it is an integral part of life.

You would think its troubles were over. Not so fast. In a whole year it grew only a few inches, while the other plants grew by leaps and bounds, as if to mock the little seed. Every fall it lost its leaves. In winter it barely survived, covered with snow. And as it got a little taller, it had to go through windstorms and blizzards.

One of my earliest Christmas memories is of my father singing We Three Kings in his deep brown bass voice. This is a Celtic instrumental version which I rather love…
And just as we were about to go back home, somewhere below tall buildings with yellow cabs and ambulances rushing past us on Broadway, it hit me like a sledgehammer: the memory of how the sky would look during clear nights in the garden of our summer house. The memory of a million glittering stars, and my father calmly pointing out the various constellations as if on a map on the kitchen table. "We'll go there some day" he said and I trusted him. All I see on this light polluted city sky is clouds and airplanes, my feet are steadily on the ground in lustrous high heels. It's another sort of dream and I'll never be able to fly.
We started the meeting with the election of officers. I'm so excited - Igor and Beryl are going to do the newsletter for next year. I got a call several months ago from Lorene, asking if I'd be willing to accept the nomination of president. We are a small guild and everyone has had a turn at the offices. I've been lurking. I felt it only fair to say yes, since I've never served in any office and this guild has fed me for a very long time. So ta-da - the 2012/2013 prez is I. In with the new.
See, it's all punk rock in the end.

After I thought I was done, I decided to make the envelope cute as well. The edges were distressed with "Peeled Paint" and a little "Faded Jeans". I found an extra alligator leftover from the card, so I adhered it to the envelope and added some more stickles for the eyes. It only took a couple of minutes to make the envelope and I think it adds so much to the finished project. I hope my nephew likes it!
Found a place, and the guy who owned it was very friendly. They got the tire off and found the problem. A huge screw was lodged in the tire towards the edge. After mush deliberation, S was in Rome and unavailable, I decided that the best option was to buy a new tire. This was the same day mom and I were meant to go to Sandy Beach and snorkel. So we got slightly delayed, but decided to make a break for it as soon as we got back home, and to stop at Ibn Battuta to get the rest of what we needed.

Bisognano: Again, I’d tell them that their risk for hypertension is the result of a constellation of factors. While it might be their “destiny” to some degree, even relatives swimming in the same gene pool exhibit varying levels of risk. It is certainly possible to delay the “inevitable” by adhering to healthy lifestyle habits (again, limiting salt intake, maintaining a healthy weight, and keeping up with regular aerobic exercise). What’s more, modern medicine offers many good drugs – with few side effects, and low cost – so it’s worth meeting with your physician to discuss a prevention or treatment plan that suits you.

I think the year would be 1990 that I rediscovered stitching. My first piece of stitching from that far back was a counted cross-stitch kit of a bowl of very colorful tulips on aida cloth. I still have the piece hidden away in the back of the cupboard, where I am very sure it will stay with lots of other finished kits to keep it company.

This is the same psychological control mechanism that is brought to bear when “racist”, “Islamophobe”, “xenophobe”, and the other smear words of liberalism’s “hate speech” crimethink are deployed. There is one difference with “anti-semite”: it is the strongest and most hypocritical smear of all. Jews are the longest lasting, most powerful, most cohesive group in human history. Those facts are not unrelated. This historically paranoid group sees and encounters enemies everywhere, but they have in contemporary times convinced even non-Jews to spot and silence their critics. For them to be the only group that has a specially designated and almost religiously observed protection clause (anti-semitism) is perfectly understandable, but the particularity of the “crime” flies in the face of the spirit used to justify defining it as such. The most virulent form of this bigotry (anti-anti-semitism) is self-defeating, if not flatly anti-everybody-else.

With the cuts being made to the HSE, pro-active assessments of workplaces is going to be less likely. So bad employers will seemingly have less to fear from criminal prosecutions. The reduction in the number of accidents reported will no doubt suggest that an improvement in health and safety has occurred. The reality will be that health and safety will have been relegated below profit.

With such budget, all ministries will be sure to out perform, so we better be prepared for a high performance bonus. No one can fail, first in a budget for the future, or a budget with no Ooomp, no push in it. To me the ministry of finance is too lax in using our money.

I should be elated. I should be able to congratulate her. But instead I am green with envy. So jealous that it hurts. They spent the weekend at the lake with us and everytime they brought it up I just walked away. The whole family is just thrilled that they finally got what they deserve. For now, I can't be.
So, and now where is the update for the Christmas challenge? Do you still want to know it? I thought, by telling you, what a great weekend I had, you would forget about the challenge update. (ahm...) Ok, I will be honest with you and tell you, that I gained two pounds in this past week, mainly on the weekend. But this time I don't regret it.

At the end of the day as long as the fucking scoreboard lists mode-specific stats, so in Domination, Captures besides K/D, I’m happy. That’s a small, yet asbsoutely huge, crucial feature that was in Black Ops and is missing in Modern Warfare 3.

So, surely those stats should also be listed!

As the school year came to an end we were surprised and honored that the senior class of Laconia Christian School dedicated their yearbook to us! It read:
I just finished up a stint of jury duty here in Clark County, assigned to a murder trial. Three days of mainly sitting waiting. The first day was in the jury lounge, then in mid afternoon called up to a courtroom for the initial talk. Second day was questions by the judge and some by the attorneys, with a lot of people being excused for cause and thanked for their service. I was impressed with the average juror, and how evidently nobody gets to talk in their real lives as so many had quite convoluted stories they were very anxious to share with the courtroom, as when we were asked if we had any relatives that were arrested there were a lot of stories like ‘my wife’s third cousin twice removed that we haven’t seen in fifteen years once got a ticket for jay walking in Cleveland’ or something else equally traumatic. Well, there is one woman who’s brother is on death row in Arizona for a murder but he is appealing because of the evidence so it can be dropped back to life in prison and because of the appeal they shipped him to California to be on trial for another murder and her other brother is also on trial for murder in California but that was a different crime and the cops framed them, so she was excused. Yesterday we had to be there early but ended up sitting on the hard metal benches in the hallway in front of the courtroom until called in right at noon to be told there was new evidence that came to light over the weekend (for a crime that occurred in February 2010) and because of that the attorneys had long discussions and there was a plea deal made and we weren’t needed so thank you for your service, then another long wait back in the jury lounge to be signed out.
2. Roberto Cavalli for H&M
Whether the family-as-superheroes set-up is seen as a metaphor for the mid-life crisis or the debate about private versus public responsibility, whether it's ultimately an expression of Mom-stay-at-home chauvinism or you-can-have-it-all feminism, the fact is that The Incredibles draws a great deal of its power and appeal from an engagement with real-world issues grounded in recognisable human experiences. In that, Elastigirl's not just an invigoratingly compelling character, but also the clearest example that the superhero sub-genre can be used to discuss the broadest range of social situations, including even the most apparently unremarkable and everyday of debates. Yet where does the super-book touch upon any such issues with any such lightness of touch and spirit of sheer good fun? There's a hint of the same in Hickman's Fantastic Four, while there's a great deal more of a similar substance in Simone's Welcome To Tranquilly. Elsewhere the reader struggles to recognise anything of the situations and issues put to use in The Incredibles at all, unless it's to recognise the likes of the murdered-by-superheroine husband in Birds Of Prey or the apparently centuries worth of dead male baby bodies in Wonder Woman. The family is typically a source of at best frustration and at worse trauma in the super-book, while mothers are either burdens to be supported, jailers to be escaped or ghosts to faux-tragically mourn and avenge. Whatever the strengths and limitations of its politics, the family metaphor at the heart of the Incredibles generates powerful emotions and stimulates fundamental questions, whereas so much of the sub-genre's traditional fare works to narrow down the same to a safe, unthreatening, bloke-exciting blur of grit'n'grind'n'bloodlust.
Fair to middling is a term I often heard my mother use, and I still use it. Examples of its usage are found in literary works by Mark Twain and Louisa May Alcott, to name a couple. It seems to have originated in the early 1800’s, from what I can glean, and means something that is moderate to average in quality. Sorta like this post, I guess.
Then we went to the revision session, which was useful but seemed to go very quickly.

Gaby also came, but I didn’t talk to her. We haven’t really talked at all since the UCAS Convention. I left when it was over, but most of the others stayed for the next one. I walked up to the bus stop with Oscar and his friend (who I met before but couldn’t, and still can’t, remember the name of), before leaving him at the lights and meeting Gemma at the bus stop.

Most species of butterflies and moths require particular host plants. The monarch butterfly requires milkweed to feed on in the larval stage. Predators are deterred by the toxicity given to it by the milkweed. It carries this toxicity into the butterfly stage of its life. The viceroy butterfly has evolved to mimic the monarch. This also protects it from predators.

What’s your favorite fried food indulgence? I began to ponder this question about 2 weeks into my diet. This may have been an effort to conjure up the aroma of foods that I so love in order to pretend that I am tasting them. May have been. Anyway, after careful consideration I have decided upon my favorite. Crunchy, delicious, Southern Fried Chicken. There is something almost therapeutic about biting into a crunchy piece of chicken and getting to the juicy delicious chicken meat. It’s such a simple food, but oh so tasty – and pairs just fantastically with mashed potatoes, gravy, green beans, macaroni & cheese, potato salad……well…..you get my point. Oh, and sweet tea – you must have sweet tea.

Our Lord will never leave us, but there is a danger that we will leave him, and so it is very important that we daily refresh our relationship with God. Turn to him continuously for guidance. Pray to him and praise him, acknowledging our Lord as our King and Saviour.

Of course, there’s also the argument that there are plenty of women in the US who also have relationship dynamics that are similar.
In these four verses (John 17:20-23) Jesus mentions unity seven times. And why does He deem unity so important? So that the world may believe that You have sent Me . . . and have loved them even as You have loved me. Doesn’t that seem like a lot of what the world DOESN’T believe?

Second, when my brother Dan got married in September 2000. I loved Dan's wife, Lisa's shoes! She had the cutest lacy tennis shoes. And the dancing...oh the dancing! Their wedding was laid back and very informal but fun fun fun! And we found out my other brother David had gotten engaged and Lisa was so kind to include Barb in the family wedding pictures!

I love this chutney.This is mom's recipe which she always make when we travel.Its great with Idli,dosa,Chappati or even rice.Great for picnic or packing lunch boxes.You can spread between two chappati and roll it out.This need a spice powder from urad dhal,fenugreek and red chilli.The spice powder made ahead and stored in fridge.

MORAN, C. J., concurring:
It was argued that M had taken reasonable care to ensure that the renewal fee was paid, because the system in place had allowed renewal fees to be paid in time for previous years. M had thought he was being careful in renewing the patent in time, but had made a mistake that was understandable due to the form of reminder sent, which had specified different periods for each patent.

However, you know what the real reason why I have to talk about state level legislation right now rather than trying to get federal same-sex legislation passed, it’s because of all the fucking leftist whiners who couldn’t be bothered to actually go and fucking vote back in 2010.
Someone decided to respond to this book. Several months ago, one of the brothers asked me: “Did you see this book?” I said: “No, what book is that?” The book was called Al-Qaradhawi, Agent of Allah or Agent of the Umayyad Dynasty? He said this was a response to my book, Lies Told about Our History. I thought it must be someone from Iran, Iraq, or Lebanon, but at the end of the book, it was written: Egypt, Al-Mansoura, phone number such-and-such, e-mail such-and-such. Al-Mansoura?! Egypt?! There is a Shiite there who has the audacity to respond to Yousuf Al-Qaradhawi?! I told my secretary to call Al-Mansoura and ask about this catastrophe. He called, and they said that one brother had become Shiite, and had begun to to back and forth between Egypt and Tehran. Brothers, I advocate closer ties between Sunnis and Shiites, and I support the resistance of Hizbullah, but under no circumstances will I allow it to serve as a reason for Shiite penetration of Sunni countries, because this will lead to civil strife and a fire that will consume everything.

Mind you, I would like to be more fussy and have everything just so but personality, husband, family and so many other factors make me what I am.
God is extraordinarily patient, and his love for us is the kind that will wait billions of years. Millennia after the first attempts to figure God out were recorded in the Hebrew Bible, we haven’t succeeded yet. And that seems to be just fine with him.

Okay, this is probably going to be a hot topic, but I couldn’t let it go. Normally I don’t write a lot about politics anymore, at least not if it’s not in context of religious thoughts. But this one I just had to relate to.
Hot temps inspire little activity. It is “Pride weekend” and yet I have done nothing about it. I feel some guilt, but the idea of waking around in bright 100 degree sunshine doesn’t sound fun. I spent Pride Saturday doing paper work and today I should watch the videos in preparing me for electronic medical records. Such reprobate living.

I am consantantly on a pursuit of being as vegan (and healthy vegan) as possible. During the week especially I eat probably 75-80% vegan. It’s hard because sometimes a subway club just is what I need to be satisfied. Or I eat out with my boyfriend on the weekend and splurge. I will never be 100% vegan. I will never say I will go the rest of my life and never eat another meat or dairy product again. Because I will. Is that healthy? No. Ive come to agree with the vegan school of thought. In my opinion dairy is not good for you. Cow’s milk is intended to make a baby calf into a 300 lb cow. Sooo…. yeah. In my opinion, meat is not good for you. It may be the only source of Vit B12, however, taking it in supplemental form is just fine and the cons far outweigh the pros in terms of meat intake. I’m not preaching, just stating my opinion. There’s research to support both sides of the argument. The only recommendation I have is to do your own research and make your own educated decisions.

To prepare for moving, it was about time to do a bit more of social networking, so, a new Facebook page was created and I also started a new blog, showcasing some of our work and behind the screens information. It is not something amazing, we are not looking to become huge, but just to show some pride in our work that we love to do.
Since the trailer already gave away a key revealing plot-point (bad trailer! bad trailer!)--well, actually it gave away the “inciting incident” that kicks off the action—so will I. “The Descendants” is about a cuckolded husband, Matt King (George Clooney). It’s ALL about that. Except his wife is in a coma when he finds out. My fellow-screenwriting buddy insists that there is no arc for Matt, but I think there is. (Writer/director Alexander Payne does not have huge arcs for his characters, much like life. They tend to budge just a little bit.) Clooney’s character must choose how he will now FEEL about his wife (he can’t DEAL with her), and how he will DEAL with her lover. It’s a story of the choices surrounding FORGIVENESS. Who will we forgive? When? How? Why?

14 April 1942: Secret Field Police Staff Commissariat interrogates a civilian, who, at 1830 hours, loitered around near the motor pool. During the transport to the counterintelligence officer and to the Secret Field Police he tried to escape twice. Result of interrogation showed that he was an imbecile who could constitute a danger for the troops. He will be liquidated.

A couple of weeks later, I received a letter from Mark's agency thanking me and letting me know that they would like to work with me in the future. Enclosed was a check for a thousand dollars from Mark Farner. He had been impressed by my attitude. I had not paid Mark and his band and crew too much more than that to come to Knoxville. Mark had probably lost money on the venture as well. But of course there were the five people who came to Christ that night.

Thanks, everyone, for your sweet compliments on Margaret Cottam. I really appreciate them. Unfortunately, not a whole lot of stitching has gone on here in the past couple of weeks, so I don't have much stitching progress to show you. But, I did something really self-indulgent and took the day off work on Wednesday. I got the lovely opportunity to spend the day with some friends, including Sylvia who was here from Germany! It was so good to get to spend some time with her. The four of us did a bit of shopping during the day, and then we did our Christmas gift exchange. We opted to delay it until Sylvia was here to do it in person. So fun!

Even so, I have been looking enviously at the photographs of friends and other bloggers from warmer climes. My friend Talar is working for SENES in Oman, and she recently posted photos of a trip into the desert and mountains. I've worked on the other side of those same mountains, in the Emirates. Margarethe Brummermann posted photographs of her latest trip into Catalina State Park, which reminded very much of my trip to the Mojave National Preserve two years ago. Now I'm pining for desert.
Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say (it may have been the super spicy chicken, I don't like to ask)
Mice nibble whatever food is available, eating small portions to find what they like best. In this manner, mice destroy much more food than they eat. In a year, one mouse will produce approximately 18,000 fecal droppings. They will store food, which can lead to insect infestations. Though it is not their preference, mice will live in freezers feeding only on frozen food. This usually occurs in large commercial operations that have walk-in coolers.

Even if just one of these three elements is missing, we have failed to obey God the way we should. King Saul provides us with a perfect example of this in 1 Samuel 13. He was told to wait for Samuel to give a burnt offering and peace offerings to the Lord before he fought the Philistines in battle. After it had been seven days, however, and Samuel hadn’t come, Saul decided to make the offerings himself. It wasn’t that burnt offerings were displeasing to the Lord, and Saul said he made the offering to seek the favor of the Lord (v. 12), but the disobedience came with Saul acting before Samuel came to give him instruction as he was told (10:8). In response to this disobedience, Samuel says, “You have done foolishly. You have not kept the commandment of the Lord your God, with which he commanded you…. now your kingdom shall not continue” (vv. 13-14).

Being away from our work in Geita for 6 weeks is not ideal, but we're going to do the best we can to make our time there useful. Carson will most likely do some filming in Dar that he can't do in rural Geita. He may also spend some time on editing the footage and continuing to flesh out and develop the storyline for one of the films he is planning right now. I'll probably be pretty preoccupied with, "Is this baby ever going to come out?!" thoughts, but I'm planning to take some simple hand sewing projects along to pass the time. And of course we'll be finding ways to keep Jude entertained.
Katie is a little taken aback when Aunt Lucy tells her the truth of her potential powers but she puts them to good use in the search for the person who really killed nasty old Mavis Templeton; you just know Uncle Ben is innocent! Mavis's abrasive personality has ticked off more than just a few people in town. It takes a few sleuthing forays to finally ferret out the truth but Katie is persistent and it pays off. Of course, she has a little help from her aunt and new witchy friends.

Maybe if we all went for an Andy Murray tranny op, Father Time could be persuaded to stay away for a few years. That way, the nameless mother figure could get to spend a some time with her kids and experience the joys of a fledgling cosmos bristling with every promise of tomorrow. As for us, being stuck in limbo for a while might not be very much fun, but assuming the mantle of a grumpy Scottish stubble grower would work wonders for persuading ourselves that it really wasn’t happening to us.

The other gold medal that Tyson Gay won in Osaka was against Usain Bolt himself in the 200 – the last time the two have met over the distance. Now, since then much has been chronicled about how much Usain Bolt has improved in the interim – all the way to 9.58 & 19.19. But what has gone unnoticed apparently is how much Tyson Gay has improved as well. The man that beat Usain Bolt was no 9.9x 100 meter man taking a shot at the big man. He wasn’t even the 9.84 sprinter that took down Asafa Powell in Osaka. Tyson Gay is the second fastest sprinter in history at 9.69! And over the last two seasons has run – 9.68w, 9.69, 9.71, 9.75w, 9.76w, 9.77, 9.77, 9.79w, 9.79w – 9 races legal and windy under 9.80. Guess how many races under 9.80 Usain Bolt has run, windy and legal, in the same time frame – 7. So Tyson Gay has proved to have as much “leg speed” (i.e. able to run as fast) as Bolt. So Gay being able to defeat Bolt should NOT be that big a surprise. Besides, after Stockholm their record is only 2-1 in favor of Bolt (not sure where TFN is coming up with a third win). So it’s not as if Bolt has this long history of defeating Gay.

My favorite image editors are Photoshop and Acorn. At $49, Acorn is one of the best software values I know. Developed by Flying Meat Software, Acorn has all of the functionality I need to edit my photos for both print and web, but is unfortunately only available for the Mac. My old version of Photoshop (CS2) is licensed for Windows. We're a mixed computer family, with both Mac and Windows, so I still use both. But I use Acorn more and more instead of Photoshop and all of the screenshots in this post will be from Acorn.

You are an ad person, you make ads to earn a living. But we all end up with a list of brands that are non-negotiables, and sometimes your agency just doesn't have one. For example, I would not buy a PC even if Bill Gates were my special client. EVER. I would do his campaign with sheer dedication and pride, but still I would come home to my Mac, any day of the week. Why? Because some brands work for us, period, and you cannot change them.
Ok so i was going to tell you about my complicated relationship. We will name my boyfriend Hector. So Hector and i have been dating for almost 6 months. about 3 weeks ago his ex’s showed up into town. We get into a fight because he purposely took me to a bowling alley and invited his ex’s so that we can meet. I hate them, and they hate me. Why would you bring your girlfriend to meet your ex’s who want to smash her face in? It makes no sense at all. None. So i asked him if he knew where they were cause i found out they were there. He told me he didnt know why they were there and said he couldnt find them. I thought it was a little fishy but i did the girlfriend think and looked him in the eyes and asked him again. “Do you know where they are? I wont fight with them. I just want to know.” He said no, he didnt. And i believed him.

My father died several years before my daughter's birth and I did not cry at that time. I was the steady rock that shepherded my family through the difficult situation. I told myself that because he died after suffering long from illness that it was all for the best. Somehow, at least I had the presence of mind to ask him to share some of his thoughts on life, which he hand wrote the answers to in a scrapbook I made with photos from his life. I cherish this book now even if it pains me to realize I never allowed myself to fully be present while my father was alive. He wrote his biggest regret was that his children didn't come to him for advice. My fear of disappointing him is what kept me away. Oh how I wish I had taken the chance now!

As Osprem's Kiss sat in port, two other ships arrived at Key's Isle for the same reason. The Bird of Prey led by Captain Hammond and Lt. Tydan chose to pickup Key, figuring his punishment was enough. Unfortunately as insurance, Araxo had given recently freed Crimson Fleet pirate, Ironclaw McGrath coordinates for the same isle and told him of the wealthy noble marooned there. No one thought that McGrath would come there so swiftly. Sailing on portly Captain Yelloweye Stern's ship the Laughing Rake, the pirate crew came upon the Bird of Prey from the south. Not knowing Captain Rennaud had relinquished command, and Cpt. Hammond not knowing the Laughing Rake was only there to find Key, the two sides reacted hastily, raising their flags for battle! The Rake closed the distance while the Bird's dwarven gunner Jon Jamison targeted and tore up the pirate vessel with a few rounds of blackpowder cannon fire. As the Rake slowed and tried to return fire in hopes of boarding, they had not noticed the pair of launches sent from the Bird, coming in to counter-board their caravel! Amid a smoking, listing ship, Cpt. Stern rallied his men to repel boarders while a grim McGrath waited with still sore claw marks suffered from a vengeful harpy loosed on him days ago...
P.S. Here is a list of US patents hold by James. As I may have discussed previously, patent is a great tool to learn about things.

Happy learning.
I think, even now in the 21st Century, there are still old-fashioned gender expectations which, sadly, get reflected in a lot of literature aimed at girls. I think it starts early with stories like Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty. What do these heroines actually do? Cinderella looks pretty in her dresses and Sleeping Beauty just lies there!

But a funny thing happened on my way to recovery. Apparently, my Physical Therapist was a fan of the Bionic Man, because I came back better, stronger, and faster than I had ever been. Over the next few years, I really drove my times down and my distances up. It got to the point where running five, six, even 10 or 12 miles was actually enjoyable. We ran in the rain and in the sun and in the fog. We ran at daybreak and sundown. We ran on the beach and in the hills and on roads. We ran in front of the General's house and spit gritty loogies on his front lawn under the auspices of needing to clear our lungs. We ran in groups of a thousand, groups of a hundred, and groups of two or three. We chased ducks. We got chased by wild boar. In short, we ran because we could and we ran because we had to and we ran because it just felt so damned good.

He can’t explain it even to himself: it’s like a stranger’s voice in his head.
The heartbreak of Ryan’s death added to his brother’s despair, but DeBow says Michael is now making slow progress. “He is able to get out of bed most mornings,” she told me. “That is a huge improvement.” Michael asked not to be interviewed: he wants to look forward, not back.

This is a widespread MYTH. This is mostly said by mothers of soon-to-be vegetarian teens, people who aren’t equipped with the proper knowledge of the vegetarian lifestyle, and even someone who might be considering going meat-free. Believe me, I used to believe this, too! It’s mentioned A LOT, and that’s why we tend to believe it. The truth is its not true. Vegetarians get the same amount of protein (if not more) as normal omnivores. It’s silly to believe otherwise. Vegetarian’s sources of protein typically are: beans, nuts (especially almonds), whole grains, peanut butter, lentils, vegetables (yes, they have protein too), protein powder, soy, tofu, quinoa, eggs, and many other foods. Protein is good for a healthy life, but people don’t think vegetarians get enough. Every morning, I have a fruit smoothie with a scoop of protein powder and two scrambled eggs. Tell me I’m not getting enough protein. Sometimes I have peanut butter and apples for lunch or another fruit smoothie, a leafy salad, or a fruit salad. Balance is key when it comes to being a vegetarian. If you eat junk, you’ll feel like junk everyday. Garbage in, garbage out. Remember to never fall for this myth. Equip yourself with reliable facts, and you can’t go wrong when it comes to being a vegetarian.
Now as far as Najib goes, we also take cognizance of all the talk in town about the amount of money being spent by him of late. People are wondering who will ever turn-off the tap that seems to be draining the rakyat’s national coffers.

Most of the people who develop Trichopahagia and do not manage to break the habit quickly will end up with digestive pains, severe indigestion and in the worst cases – gastrointestinal blockages. I have come across a few stories of people who have been admitted to hospital after their body has refused to accept any food or water where they are given immediate surgery to remove a ball of hair occupying the entire space of their stomach (click here to see a picture if you are not light hearted). As Trichophagia is a result of depression and anxiety in most instances it is normally treated with anti depression medication and therapy for those people who seek help.

My attempts at working out the bill were laughable. The phrase "That can't be right - can it?" was said a lot. In the end I'm 100% certain of only one thing. I owe Gina and Neil lunch and when we all meet again the first bottle of wine is on me. (OK that's two things!)
GC: I was actually watching a clip of you in the War of the Worlds show supplying the voice for the animatronic Richard Burton, and I thought that was really cool and funny that they would think to do something like that.
appy happy birthday BFF!!! Today is Suzanne’s bday and the cmc was in cahoots to do something nice for Su…well she is a nice gal and deserve all the pretty things in the world LOL. I hope you are having a sweet unforgettable time in Vegas BABY!!! LOL.
As stuff becomes their days.
I've never been really close with my own grandparents. We moved to Colorado (from Jersey) when I was 9 years old. We used to visit once or twice a year as kids (hard to do with a family of 5!) but I haven't visited in years and even then, it was brief. My father's mother visited us a few times when I was younger and my mother's father even made it to Colorado for my undergraduate college graduation but it hasn't been consistent and I hate, hate, HATE talking on the phone so we don't talk much. I send cards and pictures of Emmaline as much as I can (every 2-3 months) but that's not any foundation for a relationship and I accept that. Instead of being sad about what I don't have with my own family, I'm grateful for what I do have with Ryan's family, especially Grandma.

And they don’t care.
Now, back to Anthony Gaughan’s talk.
Each time Finn has been admitted to the hospital for a procedure (as with his sedated echo a couple weeks ago, and more recently, a second set of tubes being put in his ears), upon admittance we are asked by a nurse a slew of questions which she checks off on a form. One of the questions is invariably, “Is he up to date on his immunizations?” My answer is always “No,” at which point I get the questioning look from the nurse who follows up with “Which ones are not up to date?” “None of them are. He’s never had any vaccines,” I answer. More quizzical looks from the nurse. “Is this by choice?” she asks. “Yes,” I say.
Destiny finds me too. But unlike Death, Destiny does not stay. Destiny comes and goes, straying to my right shoulder while Death waits by my left. They are patient and unassuming but they wait, reminding me all the time exactly how much of my fate they already know.
It’s a brilliant atmosphere with terribly wicked inspiration. I love walking along the streets with the wind and imagining stories being told all over the place with ghostly emphasis. Theres quite a few ghost stories and movies around October, it being Halloween and all. I used to love Halloween as a kid, dressing up, and such. As I got older, the dressing up aspect was always amusing, but going out for candy felt childish. It’s quite a sad thing when you feel like you’ve out grown doing something that is one of the most fun things about Halloween.
Like most of my young clients, Becky considers herself a progressive leftist. But unlike her peers, she is also angered by the Left. Becky's main gripe is street harassment -- and liberal men not having her back.
I just love ducks!! We had ducks and chickens when we were growing up. The ducks and a very mean rooster would act as guard dogs. Nothing quite like getting bit by a duck!! LOL
But Bria comes to realize she can't run forever, no matter what Rowan says. If she ever wants the courage to fall for someone worthwhile, she has to start looking back.
Jesus went into the grave. The disciples were stunned, His opponents felt the uneasiness of a hollow victory, the demons amazed, the angels in shock… an uneasy calm over all creation.
I also think it's OK to be selfish sometimes. What do I want? When do I want it? What am I going to do about getting it? Initiative starts with an I too, you know. I must take the initiative to write what I want, because I am the only person who cares whether it gets written. All the other things I'm writing right now are for the purpose of satisfying others: my professors, my parents, my fellow students, even my blog readers. If I don't write that group paper, I'm going to feel a lot of heat from my professor and the others in my group. If I don't write that zombie story or that novel or that poem -- who's going to give a flying fuck? Who but me?
Realize that death is the new life. Thanks to Jesus’ sacrificial death on the cross for you, you no longer have to live just for yourself (a goal that will ultimately destroy you through sin). But when you decide to sacrifice your own desires so that you can live the way God wants you to live, you can enjoy an abundant life that wouldn’t be possible otherwise. In this fallen world, you’ll definitely face suffering – but if you’ve died to your selfish desires, you can learn valuable lessons from the suffering you go through, which will accomplish good purposes in your life. Through death, you can experience life that includes blessings such as: contentment, sanctification, faith, love, peace, hope, becoming more like Jesus, and protection from evil.
As usual, I'm a little behind when it comes to the latest knitting trends. In this case, The Beekeeper's Quilt, by Tiny Owl Knits. Lots and lots of knitters are addicted to making these teeny little hexipuffs out of bits of leftover (or not, but I'll get to that...) sock yarn.
Hey - it's my turn to showcase another one of Janice's great images... just in time for Easter, here comes this great Easter Bundle... Just soooo adorable!

A former Los Angeles elementary school teacher has been arrested for felony molestation of nearly two dozen students, accused of gagging children and putting live cockroaches on some of their faces. Deputies say the crimes were committed on campus.
Have a great weekend everyone
And regardless of that, she is an absolute sweetie pie, love her to pieces! So I'm going to try to do her proud and not eff up her blog today, mmm-kay?
Instead I learned some wonderful things: that he was patient, caring, and skilled. I learned that he would rather keep the ball in play than stop to teach me a lesson about how bad I was. After all, he was trying to build our relationship, not to improve my tennis game.

Examining the wrong cohort has been a big problem over the years, particularly with the psychiatric school headed up by psychiatrist Simon Wessely in England, and at CDC here in the U.S.
Suffice it to say, both the wife and our guest were pleased to see the men of the house return.
So my lay person’s impression is that if substance abuse leading to mental health problems is the minority of dual diagnosis conditions; and if substance abuse is predictive risk factor for disengagement from treatment, then addressing substance abuse problems is key to effective mental health strategies at the population level. When one then also thinks about the impact of alcohol on society … problematic.

Reader Gene Fioretti alerted this blog to a Confederate Air Force Special Alert published on 20 April 2012 entitled, FiFi Under Attack from Ohio Congressman. It is about Congressman Michael Turner’s bill amendment which, if passed as currently drafted, would ground FiFi — the only flying B-29. The news alert and plea can be found here.
After admiring this piece, we can then head towards the service station at the corner where, nestling up against the Indian restaurant, there are a few stones of the north face of the curtain wall. This is the smallest consolidated piece of Hadrian’s Wall you will see, but it is far from the last. Now we must with all due caution cross the road and head uphill towards the site of Milecastle 7 (Benwell Bank). All the time the road is on the line of the ditch and the curtain wall approximates to the property boundaries fronting onto the pavement (which is roughly the line of the berm).

A couple of days ago, I mentioned one of my favorite Easter traditions - the Easter Lamb Cake. This festive confection usually consists of some sort of pound cake, baked in a lamb-shaped pan, frosted with buttercream, and covered in coconut 'fleece.'

So all in all, I think that is a decent and acceptable response, if somewhat tardy.
I just finished watching a film called The Lost Boys of Sudan and I’m not really sure where to begin. I think I’m just going to make a list of thoughts I had during the film because, as much as I hate lists, there simply isn’t any other way for me to do this right now. I’ll need to give my thoughts some time to simmer before I’m capable of any other kind of response:

They answered and said to him, “You are not from Galilee also, are you? Look and see that no prophet arises from Galilee.”
With all the losing photos, morning sickness, fatigue and all, I got way behind blogging. And now, I can't get my camera too load pics or work half the time, it's always one thing after another, isn't it? But people, I am due with my little baby girl in 3 WEEKS! And we still don't have a name for her. Hubs is stuck on one, and one day I love it and the next day it gives me a sour face just thinking about it. So... for anyone who asks about a name, I'm sure you will all be just as surprised as I will be on what it is.
Yet it seems I must go away and leave it all behind to find my future.
I’m so happy to watch and enjoy the benefits of a true aspirant of greatness achieve so much in so little time.
New Discoveries in 2008
This gets tricky. Because the author of Mark is also working with a motif in which no one other than the demons recognizes the truth about Jesus until Peter’s confession in chapter 8. This theme of the “messianic secret” is a key part of understanding the gospel – but it also means various events are likely adjusted and manipulated to fit this theme. For example, it strains credibility to believe the disciples could be so obtuse as to question how Jesus could feed the 4,000 not long after they’d seen him feed the 5,000 (8:4), but the author is using the disciples as a literary device to reveal the blindness of his own readers.
Happy New Year everyone! I only managed to write thirteen new chapters this year, which is disappointing even though I have the excuse of moving to a new country and settling into a new job. I hope to do better this coming year, perhaps even finish this new book.
invention if such a finding would entirely vitiate the limitation."). Here,
Use in recipes where you would use cream.
The beef shoulder was moist and well smoked with a great, simple flavor. The brisket was tough and fatty though. disappointing. Whereas the sauce was a good compliment to the shouder, it was a requirement for the brisket. The pork chop was excellent. It was a little drier but not quite as well smoked as those at Kreuz Market, although the meat on the other side of the ribs was deeply smoked and the best part. The rest was almost a dry pork tenderloin, but that was perfect. The ribs were amazing. Perfectly smoked and almost falling off the bone, sauce would have actually hurt them. I'd say they were almost as good as City Market. Almost. The sausage wasn't quite as dry as I like, but I'm not a sausage fan so I'm probably too quick to judge on that one. The casing was slightly crisp and the sausage tasted good, I just wish sausage didn't feel like I was chewing on fat. This was a bit porky-tasting for my taste as well, I actually prefer more spices in sausage and less on everything else.
Having grown Tom Thumb (orange) and Milkmaid (creamy white) nasturtiums last year (some of which are already creeping back again), I was very taken with the variety in the photo above called Blue Pepe; the colour combo of blue/purple/green leaves is a favourite and will be jazzed up with bright red flowers in due course. When I can, I love to grow veg that are one step removed from what's expected and these will do nicely! Entirely edible, too - I'm planning some fabulously stylish salads this year!
The last and logical question that one will naturally ask is: has the emergency resulting from the war passed or does it still exist? This is a fair and decisive question inasmuch as the existence of the emergency is, my opinion, the test and the only basis of the operation or cessation of Act 671. The existence or non-existence of the emergency resulting from the war is a question of fact. It is based on conditions obtaining among the people and in the country and perhaps even near and around it. It is highly controversial question on which people may honestly differ. There are those who in all good faith believe and claim that conditions have returned to normal; that the people have now enough to eat, sometimes even more than they had before the war; that people nowadays especially in the cities are better nourished and clothed and transported and better compensated for their labor, and that the President himself in his speeches, chats and messages had assured the public that normal times have returned, that the problem of peace and order had been solved, that the finances of the Government and the national economy are sound, and that there is an adequate food supply. It is therefore, claimed that there is no longer any emergency resulting from the war.
The woman who, like the writer of the note inserted in this post, is unable to afford the 'luxury' of a private midwife, may feel abandoned by a maternity care system that does not provide optimal care for her.
So the FIA relented and although we will commonly call this the 10% rule, the actual throttle will allowed up to 50% and some fuel can still be injected and burnt in the engine. This sounds like a climb down by the FIA and unfair to different engine manufacturers. But the unreported events at Silverstone this afternoon are fairer than the picture being painted by the teams and the media. Its true that Renault were given their greater throttle opening, but also Mercedes were given their fired-overrun, but these dispensations have been given to every engine manufacturer, so Ferrari could have more throttle opening or Cosworth could develop a fired overrun. As I understand you can one but not both of these options, so no 50%-open with a fired-overrun.
Now I need to figure out how to make some black olives. The girls love black olives. I want to make some with out sewing....so, if anyone has any ideas please let me know!
The next year I had no cake because Angus was a small babe and he had thrush which if you don't know hurts the nips like a scalding iron when he breastfeeds, so I was on an anti-candida diet which cuts all the fun and yumminess out of eating. Or I guess it was his allergies to a possibility of wheat, dairy, nuts, and soy that cut all the fun from my diet. Either way, no cake.
The Empire of Poverty is already partially in control of food supplies, medicine, electricity and all commercial activity in general. It can determine in many cases and with variations across different countries, how much of a thing can be produced, at what price it can be sold and under what authority. Its task at the present is the growing consolidation and centralization of these powers in the hands of increasingly more powerful bodies until the Empire is fully formed.
So...if you're thinking about giving your kitchen a facelift, I say do it. It's not as hard, scary or expensive as you think.
I don’t know if Mark ever became a firefighter, but I certainly never got my five minutes of fame on Top of the Pops. It’s International Firefighters Day on Friday; a chance to honor and support firefighters who risk their lives every day to help their communities and so to celebrate this we entered ‘firefighter’ into Espresso and it brought up 21 hot resources.
Visiting Elephant Sands again, for work, we found the waterhole very full of water, although not experiencing so many visits from the usual elephants due to abundant water for them elsewhere in the bush.
So Patos, take a bow – you’ve taken us to a new low and the worst part is that you didn’t need the theatrics. The motion would have failed anyway.

The Scots have yet to coalesce on a single, unifying holiday with which to express their Scottish identity as the Irish so famously have with St. Patrick's Day. Some celebrate Robert Burns' birthday in the middle of winter; some just go to the nearest Scottish or Celtic festival, whenever that is. For the religious, there's the day for the patron saint of Scotland, but that's November 30th, easily overshadowed by America's Thanksgiving.
Leather and wool are my downfall when it comes to shopping for clothes, and those are the only things I am willing to pay premium price for. I don't particularly like silk and linen, which I find really difficult to care for and while I try to buy organic cotton whenever possible, but I don't really get frustrated if I don't. I am however a little embarrass to admit that I'm rather fond of quick-drying polyester and the whole cotton/poly/tencel blend is a life-saver when traveling.
As always keep it simple and snappy! Oh and we promise to get off the soapbox for a spell.
Here is a great article by Master Gardener Steve Albert that answered every question I had about growing celery. I hope to get a celery yield this year!
Detective Nick Matheson is also starting a new job. He’s a former undercover officer who was involved in a scandal when an operation went wrong and now he finds himself in a supposedly quiet area in northern NSW where the peace is disrupted by Jo’s discovery of a body. Nick is immediately suspicious about certain things about the murder and crime scene – to him this doesn’t look like a once off. It isn’t long before they dig up some links to an unsolved murder on the Mid North Coast of NSW and some whispers of an infiltrating overseas group.
I chose my favorite book at the time, “Watership Down,” a tome of just over 400 pages that I knew like the back of my hand. The only problem was, it was really hard to compress 400 pages into those three tiny lines she gave us to answer questions like “Describe the main action of the plot” or “What is the turning point of the story?” So I squeeeeeeezed extra words into the margins and in between the lines and even onto the back. Because I HAD TO.
The thing is, orange is one of those colours that sneaks up and seduces you with its wit, charm, and humorous take on life. It's like Hugh Grant. It's a colour cad that's never around for long but it's fun when it does appear. So I suspect tangerine might take us all by surprise this year. I was watching that poignant Parisian episode of Sex and the City last night (An American Girl in Paris, Part Deux), and there was a fabulous bright orange panelled wall in one of the scenes with Aleksandr Petrovsky. It immediately made me want to repaint our summer library in a cheeky mandarin shade.

The New York Giants capped of their miracle run with a Super Bowl victory. The Giants are world champs, but they still have holes in their offensive line, tight end, and linebacker cores. The Giants are planning to fill them in the upcoming draft. Here are a few players the Giants will target with the 32nd overall pick in the first round.

We got outside with only about 15 minutes until we had to be on the bus again, and a mad search for sakura ice cream commenced. Everyone went to the wrong stand initially, but instead of standing around and whining that they were lied to, there’s no sakura here, I actually walked around the complex and found the place. I LOVE sakura flavored ice cream. I hope everyone gets a chance to try it. As strange as it sounds, cherry blossom has a great flavor. After that, we got on the bus back to Kansai International Airport, where some shopping commenced. I hadn’t bought any souvenirs in Japan, or any foods, so I decided I was going to splurge and get some duty free stuff at the airport. I ended buying macha-sakura Kit Kat (green tea and sakura – and they were freaking delicious. Did you know that Japan has about 90%, if not more, of all the Kit Kat varieties in the world?) and some chocolate covered strawberry mochi. They disappeared pretty quickly upon my return, not even going to lie about it.
Furthermore, how does an alien species communicate with these whales across the galaxy to the point they come looking for them after not receiving any word from them for three centuries? I suppose whales not only have some sort of special way of communicated across the far reaches of space, but it makes them so much more awesome than humans, the aliens only want to talk to them.
Some bloggers have developed a plan for the month. A method of sorts to help them with topics as they undergo this 31 day challenge. A challenge it is.

I spent the first couple of years making components only for myself and I decided it would be a great business plan to provide them for other Artisans to use in their work and it's been a wonderful adventure. At first I was not sure how I would feel seeing my work used by others but I love it and I've never looked back!

I'm participating in Picture Black and White, an online photography class taught by Tracey Clark.
I know things have been a little slow around here lately, and they're going to be for a while. Along with work being super busy, I have agreed to do a play that a friend of mine is directing. She was in a pinch because someone bailed on her not even 2 weeks before Opening Night, so I have just been studying this part as much as I can. That said, I need a beer!
Yeah, it's a little small. But we also don't need tons of space. Yet, it really lacks that walkable factor that is so attractive to us.
We're told lately she's been left loose in the living room and kitchen at night. Other times she's crated. She will bark when people come into the house and we're told when crated when people are about to leave. She's only outside on a leash (they use a retractable leash). She's taken out every few hours. She rarely is walked

Regardless of the unique little spot that Springsteen holds in your heart, it’s difficult to deny the extent of his incredible legacy. His is one that for all practical purposes began in the mid 1970s and is still just as relevant and powerful today as it probably was back then (okay, I’m 23, I wasn’t born yet). If Estelle is the “Fonzie of female rappers,” then Springsteen is the Derek Jeter of American songwriters — an ageless, impossibly reliable model of consistency. Please remove Jeter’s 2010 season from consideration for this analogy to work. Springsteen’s timeless value as an American songwriter and musician is paralleled by few others, and you would be remiss not to consider his name in the same realm as Cohen, Dylan, and Guthrie.
I highly recommend the green papaya salad with its little kick of pepper at the back of your throat, and the sauteed pea shoots that were just wonderful. We also enjoyed the spring rolls, both Imperial (deep fried) and fresh. The French side comes out with the duck confit or beef carpaccio, but with an Asian flair that nuances the flavors; or in dessert such as the Kaffir Lime creme brulee. You’ll find sea bass in tamarind coconut sauce, and if they offer anything in the clay pot, take it; it is always delicious. The seating is casual and the prices are reasonable ($9 to $12 for appetizers and $12 to $22 for entrees).
The increase in Daubert challenges has occurred despite the fact that the number of filings, at least in federal court, has remained consistent over the same time period. For example, using information obtained from a website maintained by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts which tracked a 12 month period ending March 31, the year 2001 saw 254,523 total civil cases filed in U.S. District Courts, compared to 282,307 cases filed in 2010. Although a slight increase in filings from 2001 to 2010 is noted, it is hardly in keeping with the almost 250% increase in Daubert challenges measured using roughly the same time frame. U.S. Court of Appeals filings for that same time period were also fairly stable – in 2001 there were 56,067 cases filed as compared to 56,790 in 2010.

Soft cradle
The IPKat thinks this is not a very good term. For one thing, "traditional" and "non-traditional" are strange words for trade marks, since they suggest something that is handed down from generation to generation. Secondly, the words "non-traditional" do not convey sufficiently the rich vein of folly with which such marks should more appropriately be associated, particularly in areas such as smells, tastes and motion.
Slow, slow!
The notebook is written to be read by anyone else who is feeling what I am feeling at any times. The entries do not correspond to each other and their styles vary wildly – some are very formally written and go off on all sorts of tangents, or as many as is possible in two pages, while others are written in a chatty style and just explore one topic in not much detail. That’s okay, though, because they’re supposed to be like my mind, and that’s basically what my brain is like.

Here is a picture story of putting bees into a hive:
I am delighted to agree with this conclusion, which answers my previous criticisms about the Biston story. But we have to remember that the evidence for natural selection never rested entirely—or even substantially—on the bird predation experiments, but rather on the datasets documenting allele frequency changes that were consistent, parallel on two continents, and then reversed when the environment changed. What was important about the bird-predation experiments (especially the one discussed here) is that they identified the agent of selection.
In Texas, the review of Benjamin Herbert Boyle’s case got underway only after the defendant was executed, 16 months after the task force was formed, despite pledges to prioritize death penalty cases.
Similarly, it will take a concerted effort people making tough choices to: slow down; use turn signals correctly; yield the right of way courteously; hang up the phone; and drive in a focused, self-disciplined manner to further reduce collisions and their associated costs.

Percvial (1) states that the Canterbury Whitebine, Farnham Whitebine and Mathon Whitebine are so closely related in botanical character that the cannot be distinguished form one another and are, no doubt, one and the same variety. The Farnham White Bine was originally selected from a cutting by Peckham Williams around 1750 as I have detailed earlier. Though it has long been sold as a Golding variety this plant pre-dates Mr Golding’s famous selection as it is, in fact, the parent plant he took his renowned cutting from.
Onto our HUGE news that we received on Friday. Our PTC (parent teacher club) recently decided that they would be purchasing 4 Smart Boards for classrooms in our school. Rather than pick recipients randomly, anyone interested submitted a little "application" of why you wanted one, and what you would do with it. The big news... BOTH of us were chosen to get Smart Boards, something we've been seriously coveting, and pushing for. They will be purchased this spring, and we be installed this summer. Yayyyyy!! We are beyond excited for the new challenge of using this tool in our classrooms. Our district has also adopted new reading and math curriculum, both from McGraw-Hill and both with INCREDIBLE websites. We can't wait to dig right in! So, that's where you come in. We'd love any tips or advice about our Smart Boards, or anything that might help us out. So, leave us a comment with anything we need or should know, and we will pick 3 lucky winners to pick anything from our TpT Store. So don't forget to leave your comment by Saturday at 8:00pm pst, and we will announce the winners on Sunday. Have a great week!

Blue screen, that is. The kind they use in movie making when they film actors against a blank blue screen and then Cg in the background. During a blue-screen shoot, the cameras capture the characters delivering their dialogue and action, but they don’t capture the setting. There is none. It’s just blue nothingness.
I used the new Sweet Spooks set for this cute little spider--there's even a little web line stamp for him to hang from! I stamped him on some A*muse Sleepy Hallow paper and paper pieced him with some Smokey Shadow. The orange paper is Echo Park. Aren't you in love with that fun Halloween-y but not scary font?
In the Doctor Who Annual 1966 (The Monsters from Earth) we learn that in their early history, the Sensorites worshipped the Zilgans who lived in the darkness of the caves. The Zilgans were spider-like creatures, larger than the average grown man. The Sensorites would feed the Zilgans their criminals as punishment. At this time in their history they did not wear clothing as they did in the serial.
What did Paul know about sailing? Those men in charge of that vessel were master seamen. They had the history of the sea at their disposal. They had the knowledge of man to draw upon. Ah yes, but Paul had the Word of God; and it was God who made that sea and also had control over the weather. Don’t you think the Creator has more authority over such matters than the creature?

Mispronunciations aside (and it’s ree-nuh, in case you were starting to wonder), I grew up very under-appreciative of my name. My name didn’t fit right, but I was a teenager, nothing about me fit right. My sister always tried to shorten it (to reen, yeah, that’s appealing, but if my mother can put up with being called Die instead of Diana, I guess I can muster on under the burden of reen), and my friends tried to hide behind clever nick names: Kit (didn’t catch on), elffy (oh boy, internet inappropriate story there), and of course Sasquatch because I have enormous feet. Nothing stuck. Never did they find a name that worked. To this day I’m not sure if I was relieved or disappointed.

May 3, 2012 NOTE: Bank closings are so numerous in the past three years that this post spans several pages. Be sure to click on the “MORE” link at the bottom of each page. I want you to get the full flavor of just how serious this problem is in the USA, while the press worries about what the Kardoucheans are doing daily. Also, bear in mind that the FDIC insures the deposits in these seized banks, and depositors over the FDIC limit are shit out of luck. But do you not have to ask yourself exactly where the FDIC is getting all this money to cover these losses?
Acts under "color of any law" include acts not only done by federal, state, or local officials within the bounds or limits of their lawful authority, but also acts done without and beyond the bounds of their lawful authority; provided that, in order for unlawful acts of any official to be done under "color of any law," the unlawful acts must be done while such official is purporting or pretending to act in the performance of his/her official duties. This definition includes, in addition to law enforcement officials, individuals such as Mayors, Council persons, Judges, Nursing Home Proprietors, Security Guards, etc., persons who are bound by laws, statutes ordinances, or customs.
A lot of caricature artists, especially white ones, shy away from caricaturing common, objective features African American features like large white noses, and big lips, for fear of being perceived as "racist" This is ridiculous.

Like wine, oysters have their appellations, and bivalves from different regions will display different taste profiles. In addition to the different characteristics of the five species generally available to oyster bars in North America, the intricacies of an oyster’s flavour reflect the waters in which they are grown — merroir instead of terroir, if you will. The same species of oyster, for example the Crassostrea virginica or Atlantic oyster, will taste different depending on the balance of fresh and salt water in its region.
This color combination is my favorite, of course, and cheered me a bit on another rainy and dark day. I have been trying (!) to do some cleaning in my craft room, and it's really hard to see much. How's that for an excuse?
However, reports of further rooms begin circulating, literally as early as the comments thread on the interview. People simply do not believe that the project is over. There's an eleventh room, some say, in a Seattle hospital – and they've got photographs to prove it. There's a twelfth room in Morocco; a well-known journalist claims to have been there just last week.

In a large skillet or pot, heat Earth Balance and olive oil and add garlic & sausage. Cook, stirring occasionally over medium-low heat until sausage has browned. Add pea tendrils and broth, salt & pepper. When pea tendrils have wilted, add white wine. Cook for a couple more minutes, adding more broth or pasta cooking water if necessary so the sauce isn't dry. Toss with cooked pasta.

I get life stories. Mothers who’ve miscarried. Siblings who’ve lost their sister to a long illness. Grandpas who just got up (at 11 am) and aren’t “really with it yet”. Proud parents forward me press releases for their successful children’s hometown concert. Homeschool moms discuss curriculum choices. I am just a salesman and a violinist! I try to be sympathetic, but such things catch me off guard.
But wait: actual people are "ethical" on a formal, logical sort of level (respecting others' rights through applying the logic of universality) and "ethical" on a situational, emotional sort of level (minimizing felt harm through the capacity for empathy) and they appreciate "good" people who they estimate to be salutary examples of a well-realized person (a “gentleman of Athens”). In fact real ethical people (that is, people when they're actually trying to act ethically rather than merely trying to do ethical theory) use Kantian-style "golden rule" reasoning and Millian outcomes-oriented strategies and they make Aristotelean evaluations of themselves and others all at the same time. “Ethics" turns out to be a heterogeneous concept: the intentions of rational beings, the qualitative experiences of conscious beings and the health or pathology of living beings are all different things, such that there turn out to be not so much differences of opinion among "ethical theorists" as there are changings of the subject. Confusion (and sound and fury) is generated by a presumption that ethical thinking must be one kind of thinking and so there must be one “theory” that gives an account of it. The misleading grammar in this case is the use of a singular abstract noun “ethics,” which creates the strong impression that there is only one topic when in fact there are several that come under that rubric.

It was one of those decadent, three-figure meals I'd normally only indulge in for anniversaries and birthdays ending in zero.

Hopefully I'll have something REALLY interesting to tell you all about!
I liked the book very much, and enjoyed reading it, but didn't quite love it...and I've had to give considerable thought as to why. My reasons are all very personal, and don't count as measured critical thoughts about the book, but for what it's worth, here they are.
Place the whole block of tofu directly into a steamer or onto a slightly curved bowl. Fill the bottom of a large saucepan with a few inches of water and place the steamer or dish into it and cover. Bring the water to a boil over high heat and steam for 15-20 minutes. Resist the urge to remove the lid to check on it.
Soon my birthday came and although we couldn’t leave for Florence yet, L made my day special. He took me to a wonderful pizzeria called Vecchios. Now, I love pizza but this was unlike any pizza I had ever tasted. It was heaven in my mouth. That fated day is the cause of my American Pizza Dissatisfaction. Ever since chowing down on that delicious masterpiece of brickoven fired round perfection I have yet to eat its equal. In fact, no pizza has even came close to satisfying me since. It’s so unfortunate… We ended the evening by enjoying the most unique gelato I had ever had. Everything on the menu had a theme. My gelato came out resembling Pinocchio with a cone being placed as his nose. L’s was centered around the chocolate covered mint ‘After Eight’ and resembled the night sky. It was a perfect birthday and unforgettable. I spent it in Italy with the man I loved.
Of course there are many other definitions and meanings of genocide, but in the end, when analysed in depth, they all add up to the definition provided by Chalk and Jonassohn, which states: "Genocide is a form of one-sided mass killing in which a state or other authority intends to destroy a group so defined by the perpetrator.” (Frank Chalk, Kurt Jonassohn The History and Sociology of Genocide: Analyses and Case Studies, Yale University Press, 1990, ISBN 0-300-04446-1)

Dear I Don't Know,
Morgen: Most people do write under their own names and I don’t think it really matters one way or the other. Ruth Rendell writes as Barbara Vine and Joanna Trollope as Caroline Harvey (to name two) but that’s because they’re writing different genres. Do you have an agent? Do you think they’re vital to an author’s success?
1.) Man in the Mirror Ministries with Pat Morley – Morley and company are the premier thinkers in the world of ministering to men. Their website is super user-friendly. You can read countless articles on men’s ministry, men’s issues, etc. You can download and listen to men’s Bible studies taught by Morley or watch them online. You can also sign up for a number of training events that Man in the Mirror holds or purchase some fantastic resources online. Great website that goes well with an incredible ministry to men.

My blog has seen little love lately, so I thought I'd share some links to posts that have been inspiring and interesting to me. I've been so busy with Christmas projects that I have very little time to write on my blog. Of course, I want to share what I am working on, but then the surprises might be blown (especially since my girls read my blog sometimes).
After grabbing a hot chocolate from a nearby cafe, we decided to visit the Eiffel Tower again. Unfortunately we could not get to the summit of the tower as repair works were being carried out on the lifts but the views from the second floor was just as amazing! After the Eiffel Tower we headed back to Saint Paul's for lunch and some shopping. We found some amazing vintage shops and boutiques, as well as having Fallafel for lunch! We later headed to St Paul's where we found the best vintage, homeware, kitchenware and random shops in Paris, as well as seeing Notre Dame cathedral.
Another thing I love about this recipe is that the cream is not cream, but creme fraiche. Makes me feel so virtuous. I took this recipe from BBC good food and edited the proportions somewhat.
You arrive at a dinner party of an old college friend or a colleague from work. Your host greets you and your zombie date graciously at the door. She invites you in, and as she takes your coat, she runs through the basics: hors d’oeuvre on the coffee tables, drinks in the kitchen, zombies in the corner by the ficus. You look up and sure enough, six zombies are herded into the far corner of the living room behind a tall plant.

You’d need your phone turned on to use NFC for pairing devices, or if you have a wallet application that needs to be running to make a payment, but presumably this means that if you’ve set it up in advance, your BlackBerry could still unlock the office door or let you use it like a credit card if you battery runs down.
I guess it would be relatively straightforward to show that under most circumstances, the activist is qualitatively better for the polity and the society. But are there any circumstances when the activist is the ‘wrong’ choice?
From the website ‘The National Assembly for Wales’s Finance Committee has opened a public consultation on a new inquiry examining aspects of financing and finding of devolution.
Under the amended law “highly trained” permit holders would be able to carry in the gun-free zones – which would require extra hours of training and more rounds fired at the range beyond the current basic requirements.The bill, SB 59 has been recommended for passage in the Senate and would allow a permit holder, with additional training beyond the base level required under the standard permit, to carry within the now prohibited areas. The bill also does several other things, including ending the concealed weapon licensing boards and transferring the issuance of CPLs to the Secretary of State and many other improvements, as well as slightly toughen the standard training standards by requiring more rounds to be shot. The proposed standard increases the number of rounds from 30 to 98. This increase is no problem as the standard course of fire in the standard NRA training program is coincidentally enough in the area of 98 rounds. Since I stick to the curriculum when I teach, each student shoots at least that much, and more if they're having any issues.
On the morning of May 4th, Leeteuk tweeted, “The sun rose while I was tossing and turning because I couldn’t fall asleep. But I could hear a good song coming from outside and thought, ‘What is that?’ and searched on a music site for a long time… it was IU’s new song. ‘Peach‘… a refreshing song.”

Today we have a primer talk. What is confusing to you I imagine is that you have not quite understood what takes place when you have a new thought, a sun-thought, in the galaxy which makes your identity, especially such powerful ones as you have been given. You do not take, as it were, a new concept in your hands, place it in the midst of the familiar galaxy and expect a sudden radiance, an immediate change, although I do not forget that instant revelation and realization have come to some of the great ones who have walked this way. No, like all good things this work begins humbly. It is like planting a seed that grows and grows for a time in the dark. Ideas that have been given to you in these communions are in movement and as they grow larger and larger they push out into oblivion the older ideas which were foolish and out of proportion. This is difficult to put into words, but it may help you not to be too introspective.
So, anyway, you probably know that there are two bosses: Scarlion and Targa. There are 3 phases to each and they have different stats from GMS, obviously:
We've had a very busy week. Lots of meetings about the boys. They have all been very positive. Unfortunately, some of the information we have received has not. It appears that Samuel's formal assessment won't be done until the fall. This is quite frustrating, but our pediatrician has prepared a letter that should enable us to obtain some assistance for Sam until he starts preschool in the fall. As I write that, I can't even imagine my little bruiser is old enough to go to preschool. It seems just like yesterday that he was born. He always seems so young to me that I forget that he's 3 now. The wait for the assessment is worth it as we will have some answers by this fall, way before his 4th birthday. That is better than we had with Thomas, who was diagnosed two weeks before his 5th birthday.

It so happens that I do. Barry is sitting opposite me and, bless him, has started shifting uncomfortably in his seat. Barry is the very definition of a decent skin and is happily settled with a lovely young lady, so I really don't have an issue with my wife having kissed him on a night out many moons before we even met. We don't talk about exes much but she had told me about Barry, perhaps to help me avoid an awkward situation such as the one Kevin has just tried to engineer.

The aboriginal car you’ll physique is about a Jet Ski. Afore you can go anywhere, you’ll accept to in actuality draw your advance appliance the stylus.

These traveling sequences are adapted little interludes amid the accustomed levels, admitting they’re never any bigger than the antecedent Jet Ski.

Wow. We're down to the last three a-z posts and I sure hope you're all doing better than me. I haven't made it around to nearly as many peeps as I wanted even though I wrote nearly ALL my posts in advance. It was hard responding to everyone's comments, checking out the participants, AND keeping in touch with all the regular blogs I follow! As of today I'll have made it round to 214 blogs on the list, which isn't too bad but I was really hoping to do better. If I haven't made it to yours my apologies.
Day 5: April 27, 2012. Something A Bit Different It’s back, and this time it has the most amazing of prizes (look for the prize for ‘most creative post’). This was a massive success last year, and for many it was the highlight of the Blog Week, so this year you are challenged, again, to find a new way of blogging. This is an experimental blogging day to try and push your creativity in blogging to the same level that you perhaps push your creativity in the items you create.There are no rules of a topic to blog about but this post should look at a different way to present content on your blog.

Does a person of benevolence never worry? Again, she may worry that her efforts to help a situation are not enough, and will act anyway. I think of my sister Christina Stewart in this regard. She and her husband are leaders of a global Christian charity called Impact Nations, delivering acts of service in many developing countries around the world, from Haiti to India. One who does not share their faith may disagree with the evangelical aspects of their ministry, but there is no questioning the positive effects they are having on the material conditions of the people they serve. I’m sure, for Christina, sometimes their efforts must feel like a drop in the bucket, and she must worry that they aren’t doing enough, but here she has her faith to sustain her, and she knows that it is better to act in spite of her worry and doubt, than not to help those they can reach. And always, she strives to do a little bit more.

Once I got beyond that I decided I would check out the New York Literary Agency, and let me tell you that with just a little research into what makes a reputable agency, that site alone should have you running. Why? Well, here are just a few of the things I see wrong with it. Nowhere is there a list of clients, books, or sales. Instead they seem busy touting the types of manuscripts they receive and how they will market your book. They are located in NYC, where they meet with “buyers.” Buyers? What does that mean? The only people I know who meet with buyers are sales reps from the publishing houses. What about editors? You know. The people who buy the books from agents. Oh, and I could go on and on. Take a moment to look at their diverse list of clients. Doctors and lawyers! Whoo-hoo.
The book does highlight some interesting issues that will make your peepers pop & kick your brain cells into gear, so yes, in a sense, I am more aware of certain things, would like to try out healthier options, try switch up certain bad eating habits with good ones, but honestly, it didn’t change my life, I didn’t convert to anything overnight. The Power that got me curious to read the book wasn’t powerful over me. I’m not sure if that disappoints me or if it pleases me to generally know better than to have a book convert me as soon as I read the last page.

So the laptop was right there and as she seemed focused on her current game, I started googling. Lots of 'cry it out' stuff came up, which I wasn't interested in of course. Then somehow I landed on a page mentioning aware parenting and I followed it just because it sounded like something I would be interested in and lo and behold, there was a whole thing about crying!

This can be a touchy subject and please read (and believe) my words - I know there are families/children in the Dallas area that are in desperate need of this kind of help. Walmart is providing a huge service to those families, and in turn to DISD so the school system (i.e. taxpayers) doesn't have to foot the bill. In theory it's a win-win, the private sector helping the public sector. What I have a problem with are parents taking advantage of the system and getting free lunches for their children when they have no need (breakfast has now been taken off the table for this discussion since Walmart's backing that in our city). It all comes down to priorities.
But, hey! That's what a lazy Saturday is all about. I think I'll round out my self-centered/ lazy day eating a cookie of myself and painting my toenails! Good day to you sir!
I’ve thought about it a lot, and I’ve decided, as good as it sounds, it’s not for me.
Pepe, who played a blinder, brought down Gomez inside the box and Robin beat Ike Cassillas to level the aggregate 3-3 in the 26th minute. Madrid started piling up pressure and creating more chances with Benzema and Ronaldo.
Making someone into an idol or the constant center of attention can bring undue pressure on people and make them vulnerable to negative behavior. Over the years, I have seen many kids turn to substance use because they didn’t make the all-star team or came in second in a competition or couldn’t maintain a 4.0 GPA after transitioning to college. It’s important for kids to achieve balance in their lives. They should be the best they can be, and not put pressure on themselves to surpass their latest accomplishment. Encourage them to work to please only themselves.

Having acknowledged the need for rest, and without laying guilt at the door of anyone who stayed home last Sunday, I still found our low attendance ironic, if understandable. It was ironic because it was Easter 2. Easter Sunday, of course, is the climax of the church year, but it is by no means the dénouement. The whole point of the entire rest of the church year is that we Christians live post-Easter. We are a resurrected people.
It is fair to say that Sorensen was responsible for much of the brilliance of JFK's set-piece speeches. The 1961 inaugural address included this sentence, which, in historical context, crystallized the attitude of JFK as a Cold Warrior: Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, in order to assure the survival and the success of liberty.Of course, JFK was a remarkable extemporaneous speaker, as the old films of his press conferences demonstrate, so Sorensen and Kennedy were an excellent team.
NOTE: this is “the secret” to manifesting what you want. It has to come from the highest place of love, peace, and non-attachment. Many people long for things, but are afraid to not have them, so the vibration of fear pulls in more things for them to be afraid of. What we get, our “reality,” is always a direct match with who we are being. When I am interested and yet not attached to having new clients, they show up on their own. When I am worried about money and feeling frustrated, nothing I do seems to work.
I also learnt that I wasn't much of an actor myself. Years later, as a beginner-writer, I came across the bizarre suggestion that you should "cut all adverbs". This is the bastard, tyrannical offspring off a good regime: fiction is built of character-in-action, so keep looking for the perfect verb for that action and don't settle for a bland one spiced up with an adverb. At which point, I had... well, I was going to say a lightbulb moment, but it was more of an olive-oil-and-wick-lamp moment, which sent me back to my undergraduate copy of Aristotle's Poetics:

Word of the bubbling ocean up north got briefly into the media, and provoked a fascinating response. The New York Times, for example, published a story that mentioned the reports,and then insisted in strident terms that reputable scientists had proven that the methane plumes were perfectly normal, part of the Arctic Ocean’s slow response to the warming that followed the end of the last ice age. This same “nothing to see here, move along” attitude duly appeared elsewhere in the media. What makes this fascinating is that the New York Times, not that many years earlier, carried bucketloads of stories about the threat of climate change, including stories that warned about the risk that the thawing out of the Arctic might release plumes of methane into the atmosphere.

I was teaching a Sunday school lesson about how we cannot earn God’s love with good deeds or being “good” people. After I taught what the curriculum said, I felt Jesus telling me to ask the kids the “big” question. So I asked, “If we can’t earn God’s love with deeds — and He will love us no matter what we do — then why do we give food and clothes to homeless people, donate money to orphanages, be kind to mean people, obey and respect our parents, never lie, and do everything else the Bible says to do? If God will love us even if we don’t do those things, why should we do them?” I had no idea how to answer that question myself, really. Then, a little second grade girl raised her hand confidently. I pointed to her. She sat up with big brown eyes and said in a matter-of-fact tone, “Because we want to love Him back.”

One good reason might be the admission charge (almost as much as for the Tower of London and rather more than for the royal yacht Britannia), and another, the fact that it isn't that spectacular in itself, nor is the story it tells that unfamiliar. But I donned the compulsory plastic overshoes and wandered through its main state-rooms.
Is it weird to say that writing this blog has made me a happier person? If so, maybe I’m weird, because it has helped me so much. I said it before, but it’s worth repeating. I am happier when I write here. I am thrilled by the comments, and the e-mails, and the random messages from people who love the things I say. I feel like I’m not such a louse.
You have three choices of meal rations for you and your family (more on them soon). There is Filling, Meager, and Bare Bones. Meager seems like the rational choice as you know that sacrifice must be made to get to the glorious land of Oregon. This is not a Four Seasons Trail. You are the head of this expedition and your choices now determine the outcome of this dangerous but rewarding journey. So this is what you should do.

However, the terms that Frey lays out for authors are atrocious and exploitative—a pittance of a fee ($250!), vaguely defined profit sharing, no copyright, no public acknowledgment of authorship, and so on. And the model of success that Frey sells authors on, his young adult novel I Am Number Four, turns out to be not much of a success at all for his co-author. (Full disclosure—as an editor, I passed on I Am Number Four, partly because the secrecy over authorship gave me the willies.)

A bad man and black,
Maybe I am single, maybe I am lonely, maybe I am “differently healthy”. But this is as it should be/is at this moment. Tomorrow I may have a different amount of company and a different level of health, a different appearance, a different age, a different social status – w.r.t. humans and dEvAs. And that is as it should be/is then.
“The first full-length, Multiple Choice, was recorded in the winter of 1980, using Roland Strings, a mini-Korg, some ARP synthesizers and a Boss DR-55, a drum machine that was intensivly used by many minimal synth bands during the 80s and by legendary bands like Sisters of Mercy or New Order in their first songs.

The conception of rock discourse and authenticity owes much to my collaborators in an ongoing project on rock criticism, Ulf Lindberg, Morten Michelsen and Hans Weisethaunet. This group will without doubt develop the discussion much further in its later publications. The presentation of Nordic rock history owes much to information and comments provided by Johan Fornäs and Lisbeth Ihlemann.
There is no rest for the wicked! I now only have 25 days left until my final hand in and I am very swiftly moving onto my next project. An interactive version of Arthur Herzog Jr.’s book ‘The Swarm’.

Let’s do a post actually connected to the blog’s subtitle. Ethics in deterministic world. I’m getting close to a paradox with this one. But bear with me. It’s not a place to argue about: existance of transcedent values, free will or God. So suppose there are none of these in our universe. It’s a blind end of philosophy, a path of reason that leads to a place not particulary pleasant. Nihilism, determinism, atheism. Three words of horror. I want to pose a question here. What can you do when you found these three snakes creeping in your bedroom (and I’m sorry for such a disgusting metaphore).
So, if the formerly-neutral term is now male-specific, I think it’s time we dust off the formerly-male term and declare it the new neutral. In its older form, this would be ‘vir’, but the direct modern descendant is ‘were’*. Plural weres. Fireweres, fisherweres, congressweres, policeweres, salesweres. Imagine a stereotypical surfer dude thoughtfully addressing a stranger whose gender identity is not clear to him: “Were, that was a sick wave you just rode, were! Weeerrrreee that was awesome. Waves like that separate the weres from the kids, were.” Imagine Aragorn rallying the army in front of the gates to Mordor: “By all that you hold dear on this good earth, I bid you stand, Weres of the West!”

And Michael was such a smart addition to the story. As Emma and her band of misfits get deeper and deeper into the world of necromancers Michael’s ability to see and intercede in situations that freeze other characters (literally) is an obvious plus. Because Michael only understands logic (and not the gray area most of our reasoning occurs in) he becomes this walking truth indicator for the group. If Michael sees it, believes it, accepts it…it must be true. Helps to bring a lot of the characters into the paranormal loop fast.

Whilst it may not have gained the view counts of Justin Beiber, or people getting hit in the face or kittens, there are people out there who are producing high quality science content. One such individual is Rob Bryanton, whose physics videos have had over 6 million views, with his ‘Imagining the 10th Dimension‘ video receiving particular praise and attention. “The project was born from a personal obsession I have had since I came up with this idea in the early 1980′s. I imagined a way to be able to visualise the extra spatial dimensions. And when I then discovered that with string theory there were ten spatial dimensions, I created this video so I could give people a way to visualise it, that was launched in July 2006 and it immediately took off…” he said. Rob’s videos demonstrate the medium being used as an engaging way of explaining complex scientific ideas.Thank you so much for your support, Ben, and also to Tom Ridgewell, the hugely popular youtuber whose TomSka channel is currently at almost 150 million views.

Oh, one thing to mention….you know how a lot of pools have signs to “shower” before entering the pool? And you know how a lot of people tend to ignore those? I am one of those people and today a little bit ‘o karma bit me. One of the strokes I do is to hold this rubber, figure-8 block in between my knees and just swim with my arms. Well, when you lather up your legs with lotion the morning BEFORE you swim in the pool, and you don’t shower before you get in the pool, yesterday morning’s lotion seems to magically appear and it is difficult to keep said figure-8 rubber block in between the knees. It popped out twice while I was summing. In the middle of the lane.

I have been on the hunt for the perfect banana bread recipe. I’ve had it before. Back when I was living in Washington DC and going to law school, I lived in a house with 2 other women, and during one summer both girls were gone and we had 2 temporary people staying in the house instead. I remember that the girl was very sweet and made this amazing banana bread with blueberries that to this day I have yet to be able to replicate. It was crunchy on the outside and soft and delectable inside. She said it was her mom’s secret recipe. She wouldn’t share. For that I will always harbor some ill will in her direction. Even though I can’t remember her name or what she looked like. But still! Resent her for keeping that recipe from me I shall!
I used quite a few of Coffee Break's stencils on this page; the rain cloud, both of the splatters, the giant x (which you can't really see, but it provided some of the violet texture), the dots and the clock numbers. The giant letters O & Y were done using guilder's paste. It had never occurred to me to use it on chipboard before. I was looking at the letters thinking they needed texture and had a "duh!" moment when I thought of my paste. Here is a close-up of the letters:

While this was happening in our street, some parts of town had no rain at all! There is a low hill between here and the rest of the town which seems to be the dividing line, rain falls on one side of the hill but not the other. On Monday it was obviously our turn, while a couple of days ago the other side of the hill had their turn. In yesterday afternoon's storm quite a bit of hail fell here - I wonder what they had in town? We are only a few kilometres away from the centre of town, but there is that hill.......

It probably took me about a week to learn the gestures and probably about two months or so to get pretty good with the iPhone. Now, it’s just incredible!”

The way in which we’re spending—largely without thinking—has fueled the “economy of crap,” as Amy calls it (check out Amy’s thought-provoking post entitled, The Harbingers of Decline). Companies produce more and more stuff that adds no value to our lives and eventually ends up in landfills. The environment is more polluted and ravaged of resources, consumer debt rises, and the only ones who gain are corporations and Wall Street.

“The grandest teaching of Christ was not that you shall have everlasting life—but that you do; not that you shall have brotherhood in God, but that you do; not that you shall have whatever you request, but that you do. All that is required is to know this. For you are the creator of your reality, and life can show up no other way for you than that way in which you think it will. You think it into being. This is the first step in creation. God the Father is thought. Your thought is the parent which gives birth to all things.” CWG Book 1

I’ve also seen a funky drop-down menu on the front page of this site. It might be a bit pie in the sky, but if I have time I might give it a go.

Anyway-again, what I think is useful for these sorts of things is a POLL (over in the right-hand margin). But I also like the comments section, because I like hearing people say the DETAILS of they do: "Well, for someone we don't know, I spend $x; but for close friends' kids, I spend more like $2x" or "I let my child choose a gift, and anything up to $20 is fine" or "We've been spending $30, but that was when we hardly went to any parties; now that the kids are getting invited to more, we have to cut it back to more like $15" or "I don't have a plan: sometimes I spend $5, sometimes I spend $40" or "It depends on the location of the party: if it's a home party I aim for $10, but if it's a big exciting place I aim for more like $25" or "Well, we MAKE gifts, so it's harder to figure out, but probably $5 for the materials, and the result is the equivalent of a $15 gift."

Scenario was incursion, one I love and know how to play. Left flag went away, and my Reavers were controlling the right one but he did good on dealing with them. I feated simply to kill one of his contesting infantry guys with a Demo Corp and running the other two, plus the few remaining Reavers up the field and sit there with super tough and no knockdown. The Kodiak advanced and killed a couple of infantry guys as well. He pushed forward as much as he could. He tried, honestly, but the very few super tough rolls I made (I made VERY few during the whole tourney) were the ones that counted. He finished his turn feating, making his infantry immortal, with one of them contesting a flag. I already had 1 point from last turn.
And afterward receive me to glory. Whom have I in heaven but You?
Roundly ignored upon release (the album was un-issued in the U.S.), the failure of “Gypsy Blood” signaled the coming musical backslide—Spandau Ballet were just around the corner—that the English record buying public willingly accepted. 30 years later, it still stands alone, reflective of a time when music took chances and changed lives.

I don't go to many yard sales. I liked to go when the kids were young and gas wasn't so high. I enjoyed looking for bargain clothing for them when they were little - and not so picky about what they wore and got dirty outdoors. However, there was an ad in our local paper that caught my eye this weekend, in the midst of all the goodies listed were the words "stamping up" . Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm....... I decided the weather was great so it might be worth a drive early the next morning. I had a few errands I could do while out anyway.

Throughout the day we got to spend time with just the four of us. We hung out in one of the rooms that didn't have any children in it. We hung out outside with just us. We rocked our boys, and fed them bottles, and snuggled them. We whispered promises to be back as soon as we could be back. We cried at random moments throughout the day, knowing it would soon be ending.
As a result, the Savings Bank employed a selection of people that was, in many ways, more 'inclusive' and 'diverse' than many modern workplaces. That's putting it politely. All human life was there, from battle-scarred war veterans to people who would now be diagnosed as autistic. The one thing they all had in common was an aptitude for numbers.
Ultimately, it’s been quite a productive week.
Labels are limiting and lugubrious. We label people as a way to contain them, as well as to create a consistent, pre-determined expectation. This is tremendously unfair…
Ridley Scott presents us with a smart film, cleverly making use of the gangster genre by examining it from a modern angle. The character of Frank is informed by the gangsters before him, but updated by modern business methods. If the product had been a legal one, this could have been simply a movie about a daring entrepreneur and his rise to wealth. But, Scott reminds us, this is a product that kills people and gets them killing each other. Filmed primarily in bright daylight colors, we see that this isn't a noirish gangster, but a figure who knows how to grab power in broad daylight and get away with it, just as easily as shooting Tango in the head. The film is packed with major talent; Chiwetel Ejiofor's hopelessly impressionable Huey, RZA's classic junkie impersonation, Idris Elba's ruthlessly clueless Tango, Armand Assante's Renaissance man mob boss, Josh Brolin's so crooked he doesn't even think about it, Trupo, and Clarence Williams III's convincing older patriarch Bumpy Johnson. That being said, the movie clearly belongs to Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe, both leaving no room for doubt that they are the center of everything.

I think I know exactly what I did to deserve this. I beat not one, but two tickets in traffic court. Shocking, I know. The first time I was accused of running a stop sign, which I did not run. I was there long enough to yell at all the kids “You better have your seat-belts on right, there’s a cop over there!” The judge agreed yelling that while already stopped and waiting to make sure everyone was in compliance was long enough to constitute a full stop. Then last year, I was stopped for going 55 in a 45. I let the officer know the speed limit was 55. He made note of exactly where he clocked me on the ticket. So, I took a picture of the speed limit sign and noted its exact location. “Oh yes,” said the DA, “the speed limit does go up right when you pass Bandas (Mexican Food Restaurant).” Case dismissed.

And finally, there’s the story of the Australian boy who just had enough and became a hero to many by slamming his bully to the ground. Just as we saw with the death of Osama Bin Laden, as people took to the street to celebrate, many celebrated this boy fighting back and “winning”. But what is the price of violence against violence? How can we celebrate the pain or death of another? When someone who is a bully is beaten there is a vindication felt and a sense that the senselessness of the violence and hurt is finally over. Is it human nature to celebrate this violence or is it a continuation of our need to have violence in our lives. Certainly one side of me wants to celebrate and cheer as loud as everyone else and then another side regrets that we have to have violence to end a violent person. This was a big debate this year and will continue to be one. Continue to write in your thoughts and opinions. The debate is a good thing and we should work together to discuss better ways to end bullying.
That, however, is NOT a reason not to ensure that your course (or facility in the case of a track) is ready for record ratification. If you are consistently inviting and having the best athletes in the world compete at your facility, one must assume that on any given day a record could be coming. Because, after all, records are the best performances ever, and typically they come when the best are competing against each other, and they typically come when least expected. After all Robert Cheruiyot did set a course record of 2:05:52 when he won last year – indicating that fast times could be run!

On 31 January 1985 the State President of South Africa, P W Botha, speaking in parliament, offered Mandela his freedom on condition that he 'unconditionally rejected violence as a political weapon'. Mandela refused! It was the sixth such offer - earlier ones, as far back as 1973, offering to remit his life sentence on condition that he recognised the Transkei authorities and agreed to settle their as a Transkei citizen.

In 2005 you were selected for the Scottish Book Trust Words@Work mentoring scheme and developed your writing with Kathryn Ross of Fraser Ross Associates. Then in 2006 you were awarded a Scottish Arts Council New Writers Bursary. Could you tell us about these schemes and how they helped you with your writing? Is there any advice you could offer writers interested in applying for these schemes?
On this Sunday in particular, the family and I went to an animal rescue center. In addition to an ark’s worth of animals that we saw (and honestly, one day, I will post a plethora of pictures from that visit), there was one particular monkey that stole the show for us.
For Jan 16, I went straight for the first one on the list: 2-N-5, a tangle created by CZT Anita Roby-Avery. Anita's instructions begin with a pencil grid, but I like to freeform on this stuff, so that's what I did. I like when things are a little wonky, so this works for me. I show my steps to the tangleation below. Once I had the basic tangle done, I did a few more things to it. I had so much fun I did another one going a different direction on Jan 17. I extended the lines from the 17th into the 18th, and began a few elements of Pais by Mikee Huber, then added some Hollibaugh by Molly Hollibaugh, and finished adding the insides of Pais after the Hollibaugh. If all this sounds confusing, just refer to the steps below. I had so much fun with these, that I had to share the steps. (You can find the original steps to these tangles by clicking the links provided in this post.)
I love the look of big cats. They have so many mannerisms of our domesticated cats. Ever see your cat decide to lay down? They usually stand there and then fall over. I have seen lions do the same thing on nature programs.

We are *home*. Wish we had Beth and Em here with us. Then it would be perfect. However, we are here. The place looks completely different now that the leaves are all gone and the clouds are here. I love rain. Now I just need to buy some rain gear for all of us so we can actually *live* in the rain! Also need some warm things knitted up. Which brings me back to the lists...

Financial security scares me. With a padded bank account, I wouldn't be as hungry. I wouldn't struggle to think of ways to accept certain aspects of being poor. I would be complacent. I would accept life as it comes, instead of meeting the wind head-on. Leeway is not what I require. I need to be uncomfortable. The fine line between uncomfortable and downright miserable is what drives me to make this seemingly useless statement of individuality.

He is not my closest friend, I should say, and we have not harbored romantic feelings for each other for decades. We have a comfortable, radical acceptance of our heart connection in spite of our differences. Earlier in life I would not have been able to comprehend this kind of connection. It is yet one more aspect of aging that I appreciate.

that, and get over it. Your previous works will seem a little clunky, and full of passages you wish you could rewrite (regardless of how proud of them you are). Your latest manuscript - the one you’re working on right now, or at least would be working on if you weren’t reading this blog – has, in your opinion, gone from being a ‘sure fire winner’, to ‘something with legs’, to ‘hmmm, is this really the book I set out to write?’ You’ll curse yourself for wasting nine/ten/twelve/twenty-four* (*delete as appropriate) months on the damn thing when you could have been working on that other ‘whizzer idea’ you’ve thought of (the one you’re sure everyone will love.) All normal, all okay. Again, get used to it, and get over it.
Homes purchased while in the various stages of foreclosure can often be bought at lower prices relative to homes not in foreclosure. It’s one of the reasons why foreclosed homes now account for 20 percent of all home resales.

To skim fat, refrigerate soup overnight. When the soup is gelled by the next day, it’s far easier to skim. Simply take a large spoon and skim just under surface to remove all the congealed fat that’s magically risen to the top for you! What to do with the fat? I do what my Mom always directs: Put it in a plastic bag, knot the bag and throw it away. The fat is not good for the disposal or the kitchen pipes, not to mention our pipes!
I went to meet up with the Jackrabbit group for a Sunday morning long run, but I went to their UES store by accident. The group actually leaves from the UWS. It ended up fine, though. I ran solo through the park and cheered for the Run for the Parks 4 Mile Race. I saw JB and JB - former GMR teammates - racing together and the 2nd JB even shouted out my name mid-race. Save your energy, and I'll do the cheering.

After purchasing a case of wine, along with some olive oil, dried pasta and items for Saturday's dinner, I couldn't resist the gelateria. Called Gelato di Riso, it's just a block down from Viviano's and has at least twenty flavors of both fruit-flavored and creamier gelato, and they'll let you have two flavors in a dish. The lime gelato was to die for, creamy and tangy, and was even better next to the pomegranate gelato, which was sweeter and silkier. My mother and Scott both flipped over the seasonal eggnog gelato, and David pretty much refused to let anyone at his blood orange gelato.

WHAT!!! GIVEAWAY!!!
We start Disciple with serial killer Edmund, move up to third tier villains The Arsonist and Nurse Kathy. Then we get to Ambrose, who’s just about the coolest most confident villain you'll ever meet. He hires two military men and goes on a personal vendetta to end Roger’s life. But Ambrose is nothing compared to our final villain, the man above him, Beau. This guy practically runs the CIA with an iron fist. So you really get the sense that our character is going up against bigger and bigger obstacles.

And why the sour attitude? Well, every once in awhile, a fashion brochure (how the hell do they find me?) will turn in up the mail, and it's usually not all that threatening. Granted, the floral day dress on the cover of the spring issue will absolutely not go unnoticed (and will probably end up in my closet), but summer catalogs with "perfect" women in their "perfect" bikini bodies on "perfect" yachts rarely tempt me into digging out my credit card. Typically, I throw them out after nothing more than the casual flip through.

Look at dating blogs like you would look for a job. If it looks a bit sketchy, it probably is. Sites that are well put together and have reasonable traffic will be better sources of information. Dating is a unique industry. In order for people to keep reading, a blog must have sound information. If advice fails, the blogs fail.

When I passed that wall, the heat surprised the hell out of me. It was awesome. The fire boxes are to the left of the fire, and the heat draw the smoke in from the fire and over the meat. The other side has an identical fire outside an identical box, drawing the smoke toward the center like this one, and up through the smokestack that's visible from the street. As you walk up to the boxes the old guy behind the counter with ham-fists asks grumpily what you want. I would too, if I worked in an oven. They seemed to specialize in sausage, but they had beef shoulder, pork chops, brisket, and ribs as well. I ordered all of the above, plus slaw and beans, my usual for BBQ.
Where would you say you are in your spiritual walk?
I wandered the road of bitterness for three years when God determined the time had come to break this daughter of His. The combination of intense spiritual agony brought on by angrily running from God, the constant throbbing headache, and the loneliness of not being willing to seek out godly guidance finally brought me to a place where all of my own strength and pride failed. One night, I fell on my face before God on my bedroom floor and admitted that because of my sin and disobedience, I deserved more than pain; I deserved death! That even if all my physical pain went away, I would still be just as wretched and miserable and in need the saving blood of Christ; a Savior greater than what mere man could offer.
Sayeeda Warsi has warned the Muslim community to stand guard against the divisive designs of far right British National Party and the English Defence League and thwart their aims.

30 Nov – Philisa Abafazi Bethu, Lavender Hill
So, how did I get sick? Here’s the story. My wife Annie, flew down to meet me in Houston in early April – about the time Passover was starting. My idea was we’d have a second honeymoon as we meandered our way up to Minnesota in our ’76 Airstream Globe Trotter. We’d arrive at the Airstream dealer in St. Louis, MO to trade up to a newer Airstream. My retired friends Jane and Elwood, who live in their Airstream full time, traded the one we just bought for a 2012. After 3 years in the tiny 21′ Globe Trotter, I decided I needed more room. Our new unit is 28 feet – like transitioning from a “single” to a one bedroom.

So it’s really Republicans’ efforts to downsize government spending that is holding back more job formation. For instance, 300,000 teachers have lost their jobs in the downsizing of state and local governments, a crime that puts us even further behind other countries’ educational achievements, according to Paul Krugman.

I'll admit, I can get sucked into TV shows really easily - whether it be reality, dramas, or competitive shows, when I start watching a TV show, I just can't stop. That being said, I'm officially addicted to NBC's newest reality show - Fashion Star. It's sort of like an updated, new, and fresh take on Project Runway.

CZUKAY, HOLGER – Movies (1979)
Millions died in the chaos that followed. The summer of 2014 was dubbed "The Rising," and only the lessons learned from a thousand zombie movies allowed mankind to survive. Even then, the world was changed forever. The mainstream media fell, Internet news acquired an undeniable new legitimacy, and the CDC rose to a new level of power.
2 Thessalonians 2:3 Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day (of Jesus’ coming) shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition (the antichrist “beast” of Revelation 13).
It isn’t any secret that I was a born in the 80′s. I’m technically a Generation Y baby, and I’m embarrassed about the attitudes and behaviors of my generation. Some people assumed that I was given things like my house. Sorry, I bought my house when I was 21 by saving up all that I had earned as being a nanny. I could afford to invest in my hobbies because I worked many hours during my early years of graduate school. Now that I started my own business, I get emails and phone calls from people asking me how I did it. The short answer is, “I worked hard.” Fortunately, my doctorate is in social psychology so I had a knowledge base that translates easily into marketing and social media. But most importantly, I worked hard to build up my skill sets and to build relationships that now support my business.
4.) Other than that? All is fair! If her attire is not appropriate for what you have in mind, feel free to change her clothes. (please just tuck her others in the box when you send her on - or if you wish to keep items you bought for her, please re-dress her in her current travel outfit!) She IS a Build-A-Bear Elephant, and any of the Build-A-Bear animal clothes will fit her -- but you may know of cheaper clothes that fit -- or you might be handy with a needle and want her in something tailored to your needs!
If we think of telling the truth in purely moral terms, as a simple matter of right and wrong, its importance may easily be obscured. “White lies,” the small deviations in the truth that we use for politeness and to avoid embarrassment, seem harmless, even morally neutral. Morality, when understood as “breaking the rules,” fails to give a sufficient account of “telling the truth.” We judge truth-telling as a matter of concern only in so far as it has larger consequences. The truth becomes a question of utility (is it useful). The delusion that is the common human life finds lying to be very useful and telling the truth to be problematic. But there is another way to think about truth – a way that is more consistent with Biblical understanding – one which explains the paramount place it holds within the Christian Tradition.
Success is like a combination lock, and once you know the numbers and the correct sequence they go in, the lock must open each and every time without fail. Your lock to your own success will be different than anyone else’s, and even though the numbers may be the same, what makes your lock different is the sequence of the numbers. The chapters or keys in this book relate to the numbers of the combination to unlock the success in life that you have always dreamt of. It’s now up to you to find your sequence.

So I hadn't planned on shopping anything more exciting than a litre of white paint for my living room. But then I came across a store that actually sold Villeroy & Boch crystal wine glasses at a discount of more than 50 %. I stopped dead in my tracks and rushed into the store. Almost hyperventilating, I ran to the counter: Do have more of those V & B glasses left? They had. So home I went, with 12 new designer glasses at a price which can only be classified as a real steal. I was so excited, I completely forgot the paint.
That the Congress had heretofore recognized the cessation of the emergency is conclusively established by the fact that it had assumed the task of directly enacting, during its past sessions, measures dealing with all the matters covered by the specific legislative powers conceded to the President in Commonwealth Act No. 671. This is in line with the fundamental reason for the approval of said Act, as may be gathered from the following statement of President Quezon: “When it became evident that we were completely helpless against air attack and that it was most unlikely the Philippine Legislature would hold its next regular session which was to open on January 1, 1942, the National Assembly passed into history approving a resolution which reaffirmed the abiding faith of the Filipino people in, and their loyalty to, the United States. The assembly also enacted a law granting the President of the Philippines all the powers that under the Philippine Constitution may be delegated to him in time of war.” (The Good Fight, pp. 204-205.) When President Quezon said “in time of war”, he undoubtedly meant factual war, a situation that existed at the time of the passage of Commonwealth Act No. 671.

There were, of course, two problems with this. First, and perhaps most importantly, I am a terrible chess player. I can barely hold my own in a regular game; learning and mastering a variant that uses three boards at once was almost certainly going to be beyond me. Second, to play dragonchess, one must assemble the boards for oneself and that, too, requires skills I did not possess. This didn't stop me from trying, of course, but I utterly failed to do so. Ultimately, I gave up the idea of having three boards stacked on top of one another and instead opted for having three boards placed side by side. This required me -- and the poor souls I goaded into playing with me -- to keep track of which squares on one board were "over" or "under" others. That was hardly insurmountable but it was nevertheless trying, particularly when one considers how many other aspects of standard chess Gygax changed in his variant.

“Enthusiasm is the mother of effort, and without it nothing great was ever achieved.”
As an aside: this is my current metaphor for a good story — characters butting heads with each other and spinning off in new directions. Too many authors today have their characters butting heads, moving straight back and butting heads again. If the characters don’t ricochet off into a different direction each time, you have characters that don’t change and hence you have a static story.

Of course The Cribs aren’t trying to be an arena band, they just want to make another great record and ‘In The Belly Of The Brazen Bull’ is unequivocally a great record. They must be very proud. “I just want every record to do better than the last one” says Ryan “so more and more people get to hear us and hopefully understand us, that's always the main goal with our records, for people to understand us.”
Roman Reloaded started out awkwardly with Roman Holiday… this is Nicki, I’ll allow it. Kept going awkwardly with some unexpected instrumentals. Chorus chimes in and I melt into a pink puddle.

I refuse to accept this Zecharia Sitchin style of thinking, and also his assertions that white Europeans are hybrids between the slave species and the Annunaki from Mars who are called Nephilim in the Bible. Tellinger presented this absurd theory to explain the technological advantage whites have over other races. Despite all these mind-boggling theories there does seem to be a fine thread of truth between all the fiction, which supports what other experts have concluded regarding the mysterious ancient ruins in Mpumalanga.
The Venky’s completed their takeover with the guidance of football agent Jerome Anderson, who continues to be involved in the running of the club and who interestingly counts then first team coach, Steve Kean, as a client.

So I will limit this post to a few indications of the current state of affairs in Bamako.

The treasures of the second house, in their fullness, are both the things and the meanings which our ancestors regularly celebrated and gave offerings to and thanks for - an act that requires true mastery of humbleness, humility and the realization that that which we receive in this lifetime has been entrusted to us. These gifts have been entrusted to us both by our physical ancestors and by the divine mother herself. Those who lived long before us understood that the power of their lives was completely dependent upon those gifts of nature, dependent upon the magical, mysterious transformation bestowed upon them within the secret temples of their mothers’ very wombs. What they chose to do with those gifts gave them the empowerment of their own life story.
There are three main reasons for that, analysts say. First, all three newcomers have established parents.

Fast forward about 10 years and I am holding my newborn daughter while my son is tearing up the house and my husband is laid up on the couch with a broken neck (car accident).

I prefer to read books before watching their movie adaptations, and this book was no exception. So when I saw this edition in the bookshop (just look at that amazing cover!), I just had to have it. And it turned out that the book was every bit amazing as the cover.

She was one of our medical secretaries who saw my struggles when my battle began. Despite the grapevine, she knew the truth of what was going on with my situation. She knew because she cared and encouraged me the moment she found out.

James Massone (Team Cee Lo) – singing “Just The Way You Are” by Billy Joel. Great song choice. I will admit that I was at rehearsal today so I watched dvr’d the voice and watched it when I got home, but I was scanning twitter during the moments of break. I happened to see The Voice tweet about how people loved James “just the way he is” and a petty part of me felt a little irritated that they gave him what I thought to be the Bruno Mars song for tonight’s performance. So hearing that it was Billy Joel’s song makes me realize how silly I was being. Cee Lo told James he was setting him up to win. This is a classic song. The saxophone was a really nice touch and it was a chick playing it. Good stuff. James did a really great job on the song, but I don’t know if it was good enough to get him the votes. So girls (ladies) lend this man your vote if you want him to remain in the competition. Blake said he’s been a big fan since the beginning, and though he sang it great, it felt like it laid there. Xtina agreed with him that he has a special voice and he gets the ladies attention but personally she wanted something different from last week. Adam said he loved it. Cee Lo said that James is genuine and sweet, so do what comes natural and he enjoyed it. 1-855-VOICE-04
Is the feeling of desolation common? Perhaps how this is how everybody feels. Maybe it’s due to quitting smoking; I’ve got another empty hole in my brain. But everyday I feel like crying, and it’s not like I work in a wellington boot factory. I am such an ungrateful wretch.
I believe I overworked this piece, and it went from something I enjoyed to something I fretted. I still love the composition though. I have a colored photo of this same scene that Michael took, though his is further back. The siding on the house is a dark red color and the cupola roof is more of a spire style than rounded.

Preheat the oven to 180C. Place the ricotta, rind, basil, oregano, parsley, salt and pepper in a bowl and mix well to combine. Use a sharp knife to cut a slit in the side of each chicken breast to create a pocket. Spoon the ricotta mixture into the pockets. Place the chicken in an ovenproof dish. Add the tomatoes, garlic and stock and bake for 25 mins or until the chicken is cooked through. Sprinkle with basil to serve.

They arrived at the hospital and I guess this was my “virtual handover” to the nurses and doctors at the hospital’s ER. Again, I reminded Tim that while they were waiting to be triaged and seen by the nurse/doctor, to look out for signs of shock, reassuring Joe, while continuing to speak to Tim ensuring he stays alert and conscious.
Yeah....I forget to do stuff like that.

It was bizarre and unsettling to watch. I was the only photographer there. For awhile, nobody took much notice of me. I guess they were too caught up in the moment. In Afghanistan and other conflict areas where I have worked, I have learned from my colleagues how to gauge how long I should stay in risky areas. In this case, I had no barometer, no one to ask, just my own intuition to go on.

f) A support for patience is faith, or the assurance that, working in this way for God, you are His servant and He is your Master, Who sees your efforts, is gladdened by them and values them; hope that the help of God which is ever protecting you, is always ready and waiting for you, and will descend upon you in your time of need, that God will not forsake you to the end of your life, and preserving you as one faithful to His commandments here, among all temptations, He will lead you through death to His eternal Kingdom; love, which meditates day and night upon the beloved Lord, in every way strives to do only what is pleasing to Him, and avoids everything that might offend Him in thought, word or deed.

My first encounter with Barcelona nightlife. Cristina managed to get us on the list so we got in for free. I was so happy out on the terrace.

“Especially given that that oleaginous little prick, Oliver Letwin, was also in the room. Why not start on him? Something’s not right.”
The area that is today Hell’s Kitchen was first settled in the 1850’s and 1860’s after the New York Central first ran a railroad down the West Side of Manhattan. At the time there was a vast influx of Irish and other immigrants into New York City. The opening of the Erie Canal in 1825 (which was significantly built with Irish laborers) created vast economic growth, and conditions were significantly depressed in Ireland, particularly after the failure of the potato crop in 1845. As a result huge numbers of Irish (perhaps as many as 1 million) came through New York harbor. Politically there was very severe anti-Catholic and anti-Irish prejudice, as these new immigrants were destitute, Catholic, and in some cases spoke only Gaelic. However, Archbishop John Hughes, the recently appointed leader of the Catholic Church in the City sought to unify them politically to fight anti-Catholic prejudice. He allied himself with a somewhat strange political group called the Tammany Society which had been the predominant force in the Democratic party and had come to power in the New York City elections of 1800, in which it defeated John Adam’s more aristocratic federalist party, led locally by Alexander Hamilton, and swung the City, State and nation to elect Thomas Jefferson. In that election its key strategist was Aaron Burr who recruited such candidates as General Horatio Gates (hero at the battle of Saratoga) and former governor George Clinton.

Anyway, just so I'm not a total motherly failure to my little Sherman-fetus, I put up the obligatory gender poll. (It's off to the right underneath the BlogHer ads.) Give us a vote! For what it's worth, I'm sort of thinking boy. But I was sort of thinking boy last time, too, and you can see how accurate that was. Two of my coworkers know already, actually, thanks to a spur of the moment ultrasound play-date in the middle of the night, but I asked that they not tell me since Schmoopsie was snoozing away at home. The two of us will know a week from today!

For the buyer, it is essential to have a game plan. It’s for a good cause, so you want to donate a reasonable amount of money (and avoid looking like a cheap skate!). You also need to remember, it’s a bake SALE, so usual capitalist principles apply. You are the consumer and a good is being supplied. It is important to get value for money. It’s not a case of what you “feel” like eating at the time, you need to think of the bigger picture. Lunch time, afternoon tea, evening meal. What will you be in the mood for then? Then there is the added pressure of loved ones at home. If they know you will be attending a bake sale, there is the expectation that you will bring back baked goods. You then have to think about what they would like to eat. If you can’t handle this sort of pressure, I suggest you keep your mouth shut and keep the bake sale to yourself.
It was my first Clear Out Day, so I was excited. I actually had organized many of my emails into folders and could easily find the topic and the email threads I was searching. Did I have time to read all that came into my email box? - No! Had I spent a lot of time lately not bothering to read most of what came into my email box? -Yes! So these were signs to me that my Gmail account was no longer serving me, I no longer loved it and the entire thing felt "heavy" and "overwhelming" to me, so I knew it was time to clear it out.

"For me, it became a pleasure to kill. The first time, it's to please the government. After that, I developed a taste for it. I hunted and caught and killed with real enthusiasm. It was work, but work that I enjoyed. It wasn't like working for the goverment. It was like doing your own true job - like working for myself ... I was very, very excited when I killed. I remember each killing. Yes, I woke every morning excited to go into the bush. It was the hunt."

The sensation of sliding into her was divine. A sensation of warmth and love spread across me. She leaned over and whispered her adoration in my ear as I impaled her. I was suddenly overcome with the heat of her deepest more secret place and the warmth of her breath in my ear as she filled my head with loving and filthy images. Instead of feeling like I was going to fill her with my cum, I felt as if my cock was absorbing her desire and her adoration. I was being filled with lust from both my cock and my ass.

Here are the fabulous educators that I have spent each Wednesday evening with for the last three months. Tonight was our last class together. We celebrated the great work we completed over the semester and enjoyed each others company for a few hours. It always is nice to talk to other teachers and share (or vent) what is going on in our classrooms. I have so enjoyed working with this group and hope to see them in classes I take in the future.

There seems to be so many young people today that are depressed or addicted or lost in some way. I have a few philosophies on why, and I think Lou wrote a post not long about a generation of "helicopter parents" that have changed the whole process of growing up for a generation of kids. Bottom line: if parents don't allow their children to feel the consequences of life, they will hit a certain age and not be prepared for reality and therefore not be able to cope in a healthy way.

Provence Village is the very first place we visited after going out of the airport. I was really excited because I thought we will be going to Petit France.

I cannot remember ever having an itchy minge before I met him. I'm sure I must have, I just don't remember it. And truly, it's not all that itchy now. It's more like he has given me a complex about scratching my snatch.

I am underlining the wool coating with cotton flannel. Because of the added bulk, once I press open the seams, I am catch-stitching them to the flannel underlining. Turns out, this makes it so much easier to match seams! The collar and facing pieces are getting underlined with plain black cotton. I may add cuffs to the long sleeved version, but I am not sure about that yet.

The next thing I tried was popcorn. In addition to a mention at the end of the Times article, I'd read a few things online that said popcorn popped in virgin coconut oil was pretty damn good. We eat popcorn at home as a healthy snack, or sometime even for dinner if we're just too tired to cook. A while back a friend stared at me in disbelief when I suggested popcorn was healthy! I sent her a few links such as this one which explains that popcorn is a whole grain, contains fiber, and is low in calories. Also, it's delicious, fun to eat, and makes you feel full longer (if you're into that). Previously we had made popcorn at home with peanut oil or ghee. The other night Dave popped a LARGE serving of popcorn in about 1 Tablespoon of coconut oil (simply popped on the stovetop in a large pot).... and it was fantastic! He added no butter or other flavor except a bit of salt. The popcorn had a wonderful taste but did NOT taste coconut-y at all, just tasted like really great popcorn. Also, left no grease on your fingers (another negative side effect of adding butter at the end). We will definitely be popping it in this method again.

I am not going to bore you with sundry details that you can easily find elsewhere. The important thing is that many people have found inspiration in this cocktail, whether drinkers or bartenders. The Corpse 2 has provoked the creation of new cocktails as numerous bartenders have riffed on its proven recipe. These variations can stand on their own, all of them are unnumbered and therefore their Corpse 2 reference passes unacknowledged. In a series of posts, I plan on further exploring these homages to the Corpse 2. I am sure I will miss some, but it will be a fitting ode to one of my favorite drinks.

The response at Leech Lake is, “Yeah, we may not have millions of dollars for golf courses and lincolns, but our kids speak our tribal language and that’s worth a lot more.” The language and the lifeways it embodies, that which makes Indians different from Americans, is what matters most to many. While a large part of life on the rez is still about survival, Treuer also sees it as a fight to stay different, to stay tribal, to prevent Indians from becoming “the worse kind of Americans” concerned only with mainstream success. Either way, whether fighting for economic independence or fighting to keep what they have, it is always a struggle. As Lorena from Red Lake points out, “’They get mad at us for being poor, and then when some folk do all right, they get mad at us for being rich.’”
For the past 30 years, our nation’s economy has suffered the ministrations of members of a bizarre religious cult known as “Economics.” Many splinter sects of this cult exist, each decrying the others as heresies. But all the cults of economics share one trait — they don’t work. All economics is voodoo. Astrology. Tarot reading.

The religious authorities — the chief priests, elders and other religious leaders — agreed among themselves that Jesus had to be arrested. The high priest, Caiaphas, went a step further: he suggested he must die. But it all had to be planned and carried out by stealth, without stirring up the crowds streaming into Jerusalem for Passover.

About this time, 'The Big 5' was born. Major corporations thought it a good idea to buy into the publishing world. (I'm not sure why they thought this to be a good investment.) Basically, 'The Big 5' gobbled up all the little guys creating the top five publishing houses (recent data shows these to be Random House, Pearson, Hachette, Harper Collins, and Simon & Schuster). This meant that most other publishers out there (i.e. Doubleday, Knopf, Little Brown, Pocket, etc.) became divisions or imprints of the large publishing houses. For the author, if a book was/is submitted to the publishing house and is turned down, then it is turned down by every imprint or division under the publishing house's umbrella. This, of course, has made it harder for the author to get his/her work noticed by one of the major publishing houses.
Since quitting smoking the new addictions have turned to working out. I love working out, I love challenging myself to new work outs, it gives me that AWWW feeling like smoking use to. Working out 17 days smoke free is different, I can't describe it. Just in 17 days I notice such a HUGE difference in my body. If I do find myself bored or in need of one I either work out or have some sunflower seeds in my mouth. I still have a package of sunflower seeds in my car at all times, makes the commute a lot easier instead of me cursing like a sailor ready to beat every driver. The one thing I have noticed since quitting is I always have to keep busy or have my mind busy, so if its cleaning, organizing things, making to do lists, planning something, doing something with Gage or my husband, sunflower seeds, working out, or whatever I have to keep going at all times, its strange, almost like I have all this energy, more than I had before!

The last recipe in the episode was Red Velvet Sheet Cake with Classic Red Velvet Frosting. Now, I LOVE Red Velvet Cake. If we're out and I see it on a menu and I think it's probably made in-house at a restaurant, I will usually order it but this recipe was definitely not a favorite of mine. There was too little cocoa, so you never quite got that background chocolate richness that you typically get with red velvet, so I'd have to probably pass on this recipe again. Usually Red Velvet is accompanied with Cream Cheese Frosting, so the accompanying frosting was a bit different as well but in a good way. I liked it because it wasn't too sweet. I may keep that one around for the future.

I’ve blogged about Ruhezeit once or twice before, but it’s a pretty important rule that’s worth mentioning again. During this time, you’re not allowed to make noises that would disturb your neighbors. The quiet hours vary depending on the apartment building, but it’s generally every evening/night through early morning. It also applies to Sundays (all day) and to lunch time (daily).

Unfortunately he’s young and has a bad rep of being a total goofball, and my boss doesn’t even take him seriously, but that’s all on him. I’ve worked with him for 5 years and I can count on two hands how many times I’ve seen him actually take work seriously. If he is mad at anyone he should be mad at himself, because I’m not the only one who sees him in this light. People will see you the way you portray yourself to be and nothing else. To me, it’s better to be honest than to lie.

Following on from the recipe for the Unbaked Chocolate Biscuit Cake (similar to the one being served at the Royal Wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton) that I featured on this site a few days ago, here is a version of the Heston Blumenthal Royal Wedding Trifle (soon to be sold by Waitrose under the name of The Royal Trifle).
While Crispy Ambulance was certainly no stranger to sonic experimentation in the studio, their live performances were where they let their more aggressive sonic tendencies reign supreme. In early 1982, preceding the release of The Plateau Phase, the Crispies joined a European tour organized by Wally Van Middendorp, front-man for Dutch post-punk minimalists, the Minny Pops, which they headlined with Factory Benelux label-mates Section 25. All eight shows were recorded by Section 25 soundman John Hurst, and these tapes became the source of the cassette-only 1983 release, Open Gates of Fire. Ironically, it would be this release, along with the cassette-only compilation, The Blue and Yellow of the Yacht Club, that would finally garner Crispy Ambulance the critical praise they had been denied following the release of their stunning studio debut. Soon after, a full critical reappraisal of the Crispies took place, and The Plateau Phase, once summarily written off by critics as a purely derivative work, was now being hailed as a masterpiece; for example, David McCullough called it an album that "wasn't only ahead of its time, it seemed to have invented its own time [...] and still ranks as a monster of an album." Nevertheless, by the time people had finally begun to listen, the band had already decided to call it quits, soon thereafter reforming as the thoroughly forgettable Ram Ram Kino before fading from memory for the next seventeen years.

Beijing Foreign Studies U marked its 70th birthday Saturday night with a gala performance that was a cross between the Academy Awards without quite so much crystal and diamonds (altho insanely high production values & expense & presence of dignitaries) and “Glee” in the number, adorableness, and talent of the young performers who did everything from hip hop to African dance to Lite fm ballads to Mandarin hits. It was like nothing a U.S. university would ever do: Shipped in guest singers, super flashy decor. The host & hostess (wish I could have understood their patter). Red carpet from the stadium out to the street. (Of course, rows of uniformed guards in formation.) Massive video backdrop with slides ranging from patriotic antique war scenes where Chinese & Russians are side-by-side in furry hats (BFSU was founded to teach Russian for military purposes) to amber waves of grain, women on the front lines, dewey scenes of the campus throughthe ages, beside a century of world leaders images of its most illustrious graduates — something like 1,000 diplomats. But the centerpiece for me was a song for the teachers — queue pix of glasses perched on books, blackboards, and then one by one, the faculty. All this while a guy in white silk who was kind of Sinatra-esque sang a gorgeous love song called “You.”
Many times I felt that I had reached my limit, that I would lose my mind if I did not escape from my situation. I ran away from one orphanage with my roommate Crystal one night when I was around eleven years old, and we wandered through the woods to a dirt road. We walked to the home of Lillie Mae White, the cook for the orphanage. When we knocked on her door and she saw who we were, she drew a deep breath of dismay. She was plump little black lady with small round spectacles, and she never seemed to be without an apron and a hairnet on. She asked me how I knew where she lived, and I still don’t remember how I knew, unless I just looked in the phone book or something. She was a kind woman, and was obviously concerned about us, and knew that we came there because we trusted her. She gave us a warm home-cooked meal as we sat out on her porch, and her relatives came and went from the house as we visited. They seemed to be such a close-knit family, something that always made me jealous and upset inside.
Affidavit of Probable Cause- Second Degree Murder
So, honestly, I don't know if I killed anything today but it still felt as bad, if not worse, than any euthanasia I've ever performed.
The Lord will keep your going out and your coming in from this time forth and forevermore."
I have a meeting at 8 am. I will be in class as soon as possible. I have another meeting with a conference call in my office at 9:00 am.
I didn't know I was going to start a diet today but I did.
My inspiration? The web. I've found pieces online that I love (but could never afford,) I've visited paint stores (hoarding their paint swatches) and scoured craigslist for treasures (which I'm still working on.)
If such a draconian law were ever to be passed - I suspect very few people would grumble!

New Releases - There are a lot of films out this week but i doubt any of them will knock Avengers Assemble of the top spot, first off is the 3D re-release of Beauty and the Beast, next is romantic drama starring Zac Effron in the Lucky One, the latest Spanish film to get a remake is also released this week in the form of Silent House, Jason Statham is back in action mode in Safe and finally the full gang return of a big meet up in American Pie Reunion.
Apparently my math skills (preggo brain!) were lacking yesterday when I posted, saying that we needed to keep progressing smoothly for the next 18ish weeks. I am a little over 23 weeks so that would equal 41 weeks and as much as I would like to go all the way to full term at 40+ weeks, I am pretty sure that we are planning on inducing at week 39 which means we need to stay boring and keep baking for another 16 weeks :)
Hope you are having a great week!
I first became aware of the Yes Men when they were part of an article I wrote about theatrical protest for the Village Voice during the Republican National Convention in 2004. Andy Bichlbaum and Mike Bonanno are the titular characters. Their m.o. is to infiltrate actual corporate and government-sponsored convenings masquerading as presenters, and then to give heinous, completely objectionable talks, savoring the acceptance of their Swiftian propositions. Flim flam men to the core, they perform the valuable function of exposing the dark underbelly of the Bottom Line philosophy. It shouldn’t shock anyone to know that, while multi-national companies talk a good line about corporate responsibility (see any PBS sponsorship promo), when you get inside the corridors of power, human values and morality aren’t even on the table. It’s strictly about profit.
Yea… Seraph Sanctuary. Think about that card for a moment. Yea. That’s right, you can make Chalice of Life work better for you.

I am no film school student because I think film degree is the most useless piece of shit that isn’t worth 30k of your money to obtain. What can you even do with a film degree? Critics?
Back to this vase. It was starting to snow; did I really want to drive the extra 10 minutes to the far flung Goodwill to see more cheap brass lamps with pleated shades, old computer keyboards, shelves of clear glass florist's vases, worn teflon pans... yup, 95% of thrift store inventory. Luckily my instincts said, "go for it". After wandering up and down a few isles this beauty caught my eye. Standing proud in it's quality porcelain and striking colours I knew what it was. A mint, 12" Rosenthal Studio-Linie Vase.
04 Quicksand/Life On Mars?/Memory Of A Free Festival
A number of talented people checked out this year, and I can’t say I blame them. The following list contains those whom I consider important to my own musical education. Yes, that includes Beatrice Arthur. May they rest in peace …
“AMC’s original hit series Mad Men has become quite the talk around many marketing firms” (Votral). And, this is just one of the many ways the culture of Mad Men is still extremely relevant today. Despite it being set half a century ago, the problems encountered by the characters of Mad Men precisely parallel those which we encounter today. Office romantic affairs, husband and wife betrayal, conflicting advertising agencies, self centered human beings, hiding homosexuality, you name it. These are all major plot problems in the series, and all of them are relevant problems to the lives of contemporary people, as well. It might appear to be extreme; we may frown upon these people immensely, but we are no different. We know this. That is why we love the show. It’s simple, really.
I'm Alana (more formally known as the Intelligent Blonde).
Amidst all the distrust of the political process and those who have been elected to public office, we as Christians nonetheless have a special, God-given responsibility. Romans 13:1-5 says, “Let every soul be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and the authorities that exist are appointed by God . . . Therefore you must be subject. . .” So in spite of whatever our political leanings may be, let us instead purpose in our hearts to be obedient to the Scriptures. Let us choose to be submissive to those who are in authority over us.
This month I am excited to be sponsoring the prize pack for my friend Helen's card challenge blog 'Card and a Half'........You can find out all about it here : http://cardandahalf.blogspot.com/2011/08/extra-challenge-3.html.
Personally, I am excited about the topic, which is why I suggested it. My special thanks go to Curtis Gary Dean, professor at Ball State University, Peter Wu of Deloitte Consulting, Brian Stoll of Towers Watson, Rong Yi of Milliman and Janine Johnson of Insurance Services Office Inc. Without their consistent availability, the article could not have been written!
LC: I was surprised that Aphrodite languished beside Hephaestus and Ares until the very last minute. Are we all jealous of her beauty? Or is it perhaps that her meddling in the lives of Paris and Helen—leading to the Trojan War—is unforgiveable? I feel that in that case she was only true to her nature, and really, the whole thing was set off by discontented Eris and her wretched apple anyway. As for Hephaestus, well, I rather like him. At least he got his hands properly dirty with all that smith work—and he had a pretty rotten start in life (Hera again, chucking him down to earth and crippling him). His inventions were amazing—and I’ve always wanted one of his trundling magical food trolleys. Ares—well, personally I would have put him lowest of the low. Apart from the problem I have with war anyway, he was a coward who whimpered with fear when he had even the smallest wound. If you’re going to set heroes fighting—let alone the rank and file troops—then at least have the decency to set them a heroic example.
SAM WITWER: It’s interesting because the first season was about them building the home and trying to reconnect with their humanity. And now, this season is all about the obstacles to maintaining that home and that sanctuary. The more that they try to create this safe unit, the more that the ugly stuff starts getting let in, and it gets pretty dark. Things get pretty complicated.
The family’s story unfolds, gradually. As a reader you are drawn into the question of “whose side are you on?” But it’s complicated. I found myself wavering in support of one and then the other. Is Alexa selfish for wanting her own life? Should she shut-up because she was warned what she was marrying into? Is Dan selfish for putting the Army first in so many situations and spending more time with his Army buddy than with his family? Will Alexa and Dan’s marriage survive the simmering tensions? You’ll have to read the book to find out. I’m not sure if I was entirely satisfied with the ending …
An alternative way of reconfiguring the curriculum along less hierarchical lines might be to co-opt some of the practices of Open Space Technology, a humanistic approach to problem-solving in organisations, developed by an American writer, Harrison Owen.
I am learning while in the wilderness. I have my ups and downs. There are so many “stinking grave clothes” (traditional teachings) I need to get rid of. Notice how the graves clothes restricted Lazarus from being totally free. But also note what Jesus said to those gathered, “Jesus said to THEM, Untie him and let him go!” For those coming out of Organized Religion, we need one another. We have to “untie” each other, so to speak. We need to build up and encourage one another in these times. I have not only learned so much as I listen to the voice of my Shepherd, but I am also learning from my brothers and sisters who also listen to the voice of our Teacher.

So the next time you read or hear about social decline, simply ask yourself what evidence do they have, and then ask whether it is really getting worse.
The emporium into which I’ve entered promises me a wi-fi connection. I know this because there is a sign on the door proclaiming precisely that in very large letters. A frothing mug of cappuccino is procured, the laptop is plugged into the mains and fired up – emails need to be written and sent and, like anyone else on the move in a 21st century metropolis, I’m ready to roll. Or so I imagined.
He’d better find someone who appreciates a bold, charismatic woman.
When I visited Chartres in 1992 it felt, unlike some other French cathedrals, to still be a living place of prayer. The glass is spectacular, as is the survival of the medieval floor. It was also very dark - yes, a veritable 'dim religious light' - and I do also recall a certain griminess to it. So yes clean it and restore it to something more like it was eight centuries ago. Maybe go further,and re-colour at least some of the carvings, if not exactly, then more-or-less as they once were.
I continue to be amazed, bemused how some cycling chic women who cycle daily, have such a wide range of dresses, skirts, heeled dress shoes and lovely leather boots. Unless I want to spend a ton of time cruising the second-hand clothing stores, I know I will not be able to make my mortgage payments by having a revolving lovely chic wardrobe with a few new pieces every year.
The road to societal turmoil has often shared the characteristics present in America today: degraded peoples rallied by orators who are capable of capturing the spirit of discontent to win over adherents in droves. These situations provide fertile ground in which a great populist orator, who has understood intimately the plight of the masses, and who is capable of rousing their deepest fears and highest hopes at once, can assume the role of arbiter of salvation and rise to the most vaunted echelons of power. In these situations, the depressed, injured, and indignant await a message of deliverance from their trials, and in so doing provide a receptive audience for the orator. This situation has repeated itself countless times, with both desirable and undesirable outcomes.
Oh...ok...I love the ACL Fest (even if it is named after a knee injury I've tried to avoid for 30 years). I love the Texas Longhorns too. I just wish they'd both take on an identitiy and stick with it. Is ACL going to follow the Americana roots of the old Austin City Limits show, or be an alternative music festival for the kiddies? Jazz Fest in New Orleans always centered there festival around New Orleans musicians and Americana acts...never changing too much. It's always been the best festival ever!
With the cost of managing congestion, building roads, providing parking spaces in busy urban areas etc, driving a powered vehicle is going to be a more expensive affair! With that expense you do get the benefits of door-to-door transport, you can choose your radio channel and whack on the aircon, wear your tallest high heels and not get wet when it rains. Take the rough with the smooth, Griffin!
As for the ol’ Shyamalan twist, it’s back and in full effect. I had my hunch from the beginning, but the story really did keep me guessing ‘til the end. Several different techniques made me change my initial guess, but then THE TWEEST occurs, and low and behold, I was right all along! To be fair, it was mostly a guess. But the trip to THE TWEEST was fun and kept me glued to my seat for the duration.
The surgery was scheduled for the next Monday which being a Friday at the time was all too soon. No time to think, just go through the motions. Phone work, phone medical insurance, phone hospital.

Once upon a time ago I used to be a BIG juice drinker, in fact when I was pregnant with my first my husband will tell you that I went through about 1/2 gallon of orange juice a day. Today I just can’t imagine drinking that much juice in one day. After I had my Pi and started reading on child nutrition, books like Natural Baby Food Cookbook and Dr. Sears Nutrition Book. I learned that processed juice was not a good food source for our babies or ourselves.
For example, Grand Junction, CO, set up a cooperative medical group in which all doctors joined the voluntary association to include all patients, whether covered by Medicaid or private insurance or no insurance, which financially incentivizes health practitioners to increase outcomes while at the same time spreading out reimbursement regardless of insurance. In other words, doctors offices are rewarded financially for producing better patient outcomes than average at much lower costs.

When you look into the eyes of someone you love and see your dreams, its a feeling that not even Shakespeare himself can describe, your whole life suddenly makes sense. Everything you've ever done and seen, felt and fought for, suffered and survived, it all finds its place and with it, so do you.

Monday Emy and Henry spent the day with my mum so me and Chris could spend a day together which was lovely, we went into town, decided on a few Christmas presents, had a look at the Christmas market which is really disapointing this year, we had pizza for lunch and then before setting off home had coffee and cake in Starbucks, I can really recommend their Gingerbread loaf cake! Once we were all home again, we finally decoated the Christmas tree :-)
This may seem like an odd topic for me to talk about, one that might get me a lot of flak from men. I assure you, I’m not breaking any man laws. But lately I seem to have gotten into a few arguments about the 1 to 10 scale with a few women. Most find it stupid, while others find it demeaning. This post will explain the inner workings of the 1 to 10 scale that men use oh so much and I will also explain why women shouldn’t have a problem with it.
With leading Hollywood directors and Washington political figures leading the way, America is quickly returning to the paganism that shrouded the world in spiritual darkness for millennia. May God help us heed the warning of the apostle Paul, found in Holy Scripture, who warned that the worship of nature in ancient times was the result of turning from the worship of the one true God who created nature in the first place:
Using a hidden camera, Yuda filmed for six days prior to last Friday's run-off election in which Mugabe claimed victory with 90% of the vote. Morgan Tsvangirai, the MDC leader, had earlier said his party would not be participating in the run-off because of intimidation.
Mr. Croft further noted that right after his measure became law, Wasilla’s local paper reported that Ms. Palin’s handpicked police chief, Charlie Fannon, acknowledged the practice of billing to collect evidence for sexual-assault cases. He complained that the state was requiring the town to spend $5,000 to $14,000 a year to cover the costs. “I just don’t want to see any more burden put on the taxpayer,” the chief explained.

This friend also taught me that hope is what pulls people through. We all need hope at the end of the day. Something to live for, something to keep us going despite our struggles. We all need someone to believe in us and we need to ultimately learn to believe in ourselves.

I sort of wish I believed that “nothing happens by mistake” or that things are the way they are “meant” to be. I seems simplistic and, in a way, easy. But I don’t believe it. So I’m left with deciding what I can work on, and what I can change, and honestly that generally leaves me with a feeling of not doing enough for other people.
And finally, Happy Holidays from our house to yours! I say Happy Holidays, knowing full well it rattles those who feel "Merry Christmas" has been lost. But I like "Happy Holidays" just fine - it says whatever holiday you observe, whatever beliefs and traditions you hold dear, I wish you a blessed and merry time of it!
The story behind the Angels is the story of my dear brother Mauri who died when I was 6 years old. He was only 21 years when he passed away. We were very close to each other. He was my hero in many ways. He took care of me and protected me. He was always there when I needed him. His death has cast long, dark shadows over my life and only recently I have began to understand that all these 36 years I have blamed myself for not being able to save my brother.
Those first few days and nights were difficult for me.
In the summer of 2000 Nauman—one of the leading and most innovative contemporary American artists—with the help of infrared light, filmed his workspace in the dark. Over forty-two nights and just as many hours, he taped the room from different angles, looking to capture the movements of his cat and the field mice who had previously moved in. The end result was Nauman’s video installation Mapping the Studio I (Fat Chance John Cage). Consisting of seven real-time green-gray monochrome images projected onto wall-sized screens, the installation is accompanied by ‘multiple audio tracks’ of ambient sounds—a distant train whistle and a coyote howl, thunder and wind, insects buzzing and a horse quietly snorting nearby—giving away the studio’s rustic setting. The viewer waits for something to occur but is greeted instead by hours and hours of motionless debris of creativity: cast heads and taxidermied forms for example, among a haphazard collection of chairs. But that’s entirely the point. Eventually Nauman’s cat patters in, then patters out. Meanwhile the field mice hurry across the floor. Nauman says he “used this traffic as a way of mapping the leftover parts and work areas of the last several years of other completed, unfinished, or discarded projects.”
On Sunday morning at 8, before breakfast, we joined the friars for 'les laudes' - a short service of chanted hymns and psalms. It was magical. The church is a vast and resonant concrete cavern. Perhaps 18m high, around 40m long and 10m wide. The four sheer walls connected by the strata lines where the concrete was poured layer after layer. Bright coloured light filters through horizontal slits - these slope upwards through the massive walls, so that the window itself is not visible, just the painted surface inside the opening that reflects the light. The chanting of the seven friars filled the space completely. We tried to imagine how it must have sounded when there were 70 or 80 of them. It is a space that I found slightly oppressive initially - the concrete is almost overwhelming, the geometry of the space, particularly the north end, is not entirely comfortable - but when the friars sing it all makes sense. The volume, the material and the voices just work together.

These troubles and inconsistencies are difficult for secular, morally-minded, individualist, rationalist students like us, with incredible and historically unprecedented college debt loads, to make sense of. This rant is too wide ranging to ever find a conclusion except that the 4th is a day when I contemplate my country, my place in it and that brings up mixed feelings and bewilderment.
It's sad though that it will seemingly take the near total annihilation of life on Earth to stop civilization once, and hopefully, for all.

Since he spent most of his time baking and operating Sunrise Pastry shop, he hired a manager to run his new candy store. From what I understand, that worked pretty well the first year, until that manager quit. The manager who replaced her wasn't up to the task in the same way. The business soon became a burden, and he decided to shop it around quietly. Around this time, I just happened to wander out here to visit a friend in Worthington. She owned a bed and breakfast and got her pastries from Carl. She just also happened to sell real estate on the side. Carl had mentioned he had a candy store to sell. My friend mentioned it to me after I described my so far fruitless search for a suitable location to bring to life my ice cream shop dreams. Voila, the stars had lined up, my friend made a call, I stopped in to see the place the next day, and the rest, as they say, is history.
I’m also afraid of being alone (sometimes). I enjoy time to myself but sometimes I get really frightened knowing I’m the only one responsible for the health and well being of two other humans and four animals. I feel like I can barely get up and brush my teeth some days so I don’t know how, but it gets done. My kids are clean, well-fed, taken care of, and absolutely loved. But it’s hard to be alone and responsible for everything that goes on in the home. Never underestimate your partner, lesson learned.

In addition to the rustic looking buildings that give off the artsy vibe, Fernwood was home to a telephone pole painting event, in which residents and friends were able to share their artistry and creativity by decorating the telephone poles that lined the streets. I would estimate that there were about forty to fifty of these poles scattered throughout the neighbourhood, bringing life and colour to the sidewalks, but I could only choose a few of my favourites to share.

A recent article in the Daily Mail points out that police officers in London are beginning to look more like soldiers than cops. In response to last week’s attempted suicide bombing, members of the police force turned out sporting firepower that would be more at home on battlefields in Iraq and Afghanistan than in the streets of suburban London. The Daily Mail reports:

The year 1869 was a watershed year in New York City corruption, with the Tweed's hand-selected cohorts fully in place at City Hall, all oversight committees abolished the previous year, and civic projects sprouting up throughout the city, ripe for graft and embezzlement.

On my way into work, I was listening to a podcast by Michael Hyatt. Those of you who know me know that I am an avid fan of Mike’s and am constantly sharing the leadership advice and common sense from his blog. Mike was speaking on 10 Practical Ways to Boost Your Energy. (Yes, I’m behind in my listening because this is podcast #2 and he’s already up to podcast #10!) Numbers one through five cover physical aspects such as sleep, diet and exercise. Six talks about feeding your brain through reading. (Is your brain starting to feel full about now? Ha!) Then we get to seven and eight. Seven and eight along with the verse for today was God saying “Here you go!” and handing me a pretty wrapped package tied with a bow. Seven is “keep a positive attitude” and eight is “watch your mouth”…BINGO! Mike even goes so far to say that, “Even in difficult circumstances, you can choose to have a good attitude.” And that what comes out of our mouth shapes the way we perceive reality and becomes our exact experience. Wow. Someone just snapped the band on my wrist!
If one excludes Barnsley, the only period when all five remaining branches were open simultaneously was from 1889-1890. Although this dates the trade label rather than the opalotype itself, it is likely that the latter was produced around that time. The following comments were made by fellow photo researcher David Simkin, who very kindly looked the image:
We decided to go up with all three girls and two candles. I explained to Abigail as we walked up that I would light our candle. Jonathan had Sarah and Lily and a candle he would light. Abigail gave me no problems, but as soon as Sarah saw the second candle lit she yelled "my candle, my candle!" So Jonathan did what any parent would do, he handed her the candle! I couldn't believe it! So I'm freaking out as we walk back to our seats. I managed to keep the girls still as they each held a candle, making sure to keep the flame far away from their hair or the seats in front of us. Then Sarah thought it would be fun to blow her candle out. Then she proceeded to light it back up using Abigail's flame. After this both girls would giggle and Sarah would blow the candle out and do it all over again. All this happened as the congregation sang SILENT night (and at this point it was voices only, no instruments). At this point I decided the best thing to do was blow Abigail's candle out so the disruption would stop.

Initially, the officer said it was about 50% of her role, sometimes more. But once trust and procedure was established, it was an occasional thing that took little time at all, just regular passing attention and frequent ground-floor liaison between the agencies’ staff.
Yet in all honesty I feel this album is a stepping stone for the Scotts. While it still holds the ideas and music Mosher stands for, it does not rival it´s successor in every department. Partly because the drums are programmed, and sound like it. Partly because in some tracks the guitars and keyboards are fighting each other, instead of adding value. This is a equalizing thing I think.

I have a beef with Levenger. I don't write this post out of frustration, though. Not entirely, anyway. It's just that I've tried out quite a few Levenger papers, intending to review them all — and I will, eventually — but I thought it would be helpful for folks to see a summary of my experiences in one post. Think of it as a bunch of mini-reviews rolled up into a single post.

To Nietzsche, women are incapable of separating the search for objective truth, from their own subjective interests. Thus, in women’s hands, truth reduces to nothing more than a whimsical dictum, to be discarded with if found inconvenient; making truth antithetical to femininity:

Why are people worried about WMDs? Because they can destroy lives? Because they can cause serious damage to a country? You dont need a massive missile to do damage to a country. We have our own WMDs in Bahrain and they can do a lot more damage than a missile. You dont need a massive destructive force you get from a missile to destroy bahrain. We have 3 WMDs in Bahrain. So what are they exactly?

Admittedly, her reference points are American, as you would expect, but I have some thoughts - indeed experience - to share on this. For a start, that word "dystopian", which Ms Cox Gurdon doesn't actually use but which is lurking behind her article. It was coined by those who mistakenly believed it was the opposite of "utopian." They thought that Thomas More's "Utopia" was a mistransliteration of the Greek for "good place", with the prefix "eu" (as in "euphony" or "euphemism"), whereas the first letter actually represented "ou" or "not."

The invention provides for stabilization of the end of the pin projecting from the fractured bone fragment without compromising the securing of the fractured bone segment to the stable bone segment without compression at the fracture. This is achieved by utilization of the pin plate 1 which has holes at one end portion for being fixed to stable bone while the opposite end has holes for engaging the protruding end of the pin, so as to prevent displacement of the protruding end of the pin in the plane of the pin plate and wherein the hole provides means for allowing the pin to slide axially in the hole in the pin plate but preventing compression across the fracture.

Well the weekend went on as normal… Cartoons… Playing … Saturday at Life Church…. Playing… bed time around 11PM … Sunday at Frontline… Home to get ready for White Water… Things don’t always go the way you expect, do they? As we were getting ready Micah and Silas came in from the back yard looking pale as a ghost and ran into mommy. Then I hear Shanna say, “Chewy is dead!" What!!!! I thought!!! “I knew this was going to happen!" she said. My heart sank. Surely he is not dead! I went into the back yard and saw him hanging there. “I knew this was going to happen!” she said. “Be quiet Shanna,” I said. “What can I do?” I thought!! “There must be something I can do!” Silas was in bed sobbing… Micah was standing behind me barley crying with a shocked look on his face… Asher seemed totally normal and was saying, “He’s not dead I saw him moving.” “THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD DO.” He was dead right in front of me. I had put him on a tie out the day before because he had dug out and escaped. I was only going to keep him on it until I got some bricks and dirt to fill the hole so he could not get out again. 'NOW HE IS DEAD.' He had tied himself up and fought so hard that he had cut his own throat. 'HE WAS THE BEST DOG I EVER HAD NOW MY CHILDREN WILL NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN IN THIS LIFE.' Me and Shanna decided we needed to go to White Water so the children could get their mind off of it. Within a few minutes my dad was on his way to get Chewy to bury him. As I was getting into the van the Lord showed me what a mistake I was making so I told the boys, “Come with me so we can say goodbye.” We walked into the back yard and walked up to his lifeless body and I prayed, “God thank you for Chewy." Then the boys prayed. Everyone was in tears except Asher. Asher was bouncing on the trampoline still in denial. Then we all spoke to Chewy and told him how much we loved him.
So, he knighted me and arranged for our wedding to take place after a big tournament the king was throwing in Pangalia. We met King Alderic, who had me swear fealty, and that was it -- I was a noble. Lord Tathis gave me a tiny province on his southern border with Laithtaris and Vimar Keep.

Paul had a rapport with the Gentiles and for very good reason. God had made him the apostle of the Gentiles for in Romans 11:13 he wrote, “For I speak to you Gentiles inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office.” God had preserved him from the hatred of the Jews so that he might finish his course, his apostolic ministry inRome.

I’m reading The Earth Hums in B Flat by Mari Strachan, which is set in a small Welsh town in the 1950s. It has a very quirky and endearing child narrator and although I’m not usually a fan of child narrators (only because I feel I have read so many books with that apprcoach) this one is lovely.
In your inaugural address, you talked about the Canadian and British models of government arts support bodies in relation to the development of the Australia Council. In the last Fringe Network Newsletter there is an article by Michael Volkerling, the head of the Queen Elizabeth II Arts Council of New Zealand, where he discusses the importance of regional groups to the overall decision making process of the New Zealand Council. Do you think that the Australia Council could learn from the New Zealand experience in helping to overcome claims of “state bias”?

I have found that utilizing olive oil lice treatment medication can be a safe, efficient and inexpensive option to clear away lice and nits. A dermatologist again, can aid you find a product that is both gentle and efficacious for lice.

I'm thinking about re-instating "Photography Fridays" on the blog, which I haven't done in awhile, but in the past has included the 12 Weeks to Better Photography course. That particular course isn't available any more, but I think there are others we could do, or that I could come up with something. I'm just jonesing for more photography and need an excuse! What I'd like to know is if you're interested in participating, what sort of tutorials would YOU like to see--very basic, beginner, more advanced, etc?
These are some of the musical highlights we've been listening to lately.
After reading my response, my friend revealed his theory, which I hope he will write about himself (a guest post would be nice, or I'll do a link). It was that he might choose better among unknown partners, and thereby improve his evening, by paying a bit more attention to what women were wearing. We choose what we wear on purpose, so maybe we say something about why were are there and what sort of dance we want to have. (So do at least some of the men, of course, as a commenter said on "different dresses".) He knows that he finds me easy to dance with, and so he thought he might look, with an artist's eye, for other women sending the same messages.

Five-cylinder is expected to power 75 percent of the lineup and used in the Passat 2.5L 2012 model. It has 170 horsepower and 177 pound-feet of torque (torque thinking as the force behind the acceleration, horsepower of energy that sustains the momentum).This is the same engine used in the compact class VW Jetta and Passat 2.5L sedan model is equivalent to performing the basic four-cylinder midsize car versions of most rivals.
Only a few hours later, a formation of five Xian JH-7 fighter bombers skimmed the tops of the trees before delivering their payload. The explosions rocked the swamp and diminished the camp into nothing more than ashes and a massive hole in the ground. River water quickly drained in and filled the hole erasing even the ash-laden evidence of the former camp. The swamp, as it had for centuries, took hardly any notice of man’s attempts to destroy it as well as his fellow-man.
This week I was afflicted by an ailment I hope every blogger will get to experience at some point. It all began on Thursday¹ morning when I logged into WordPress and saw something very familiar on the homepage. I blinked to make sure I wasn’t imagining it, I read the title three times just to be sure, and then my eyes bugged out of my head. Oh. my. goodness. I pointed at the screen and shouted, “Hey, that’s my blog on Freshly Pressed!” That’s when I knew I had Freshly Pressed Shock Syndrome or FPSS.

The divine oneness of life is within and all around us. Sometimes walking alone in nature we can feel its heartbeat and its wonder, and our steps become steps of remembrance. The simple practice of “walking in a sacred manner,” in which with every step we take we feel the connection with the sacred earth, is one way to reconnect with the living spirit of the earth.

When Europe’s finance ministers meet for a group photo, it’s easy to spot the rebel — Anders Borg (pictured above) has a ponytail and earring. What actually marks him out, though, is how he responded to the crash. While most countries in Europe borrowed massively, Borg did not. Since becoming Sweden’s finance minister, his mission has been to pare back government. His ‘stimulus’ was a permanent tax cut. To critics, this was fiscal lunacy. Borg, on the other hand, thought lunacy meant repeating the economics of the 1970s and expecting a different result. Three years on, it’s pretty clear who was right. “Look at Spain, Portugal or the UK, whose governments were arguing for large temporary stimulus,” he says. “Well, we can see that very little of the stimulus went to the economy. But they are stuck with the debt.” Tax-cutting Sweden, by contrast, had the fastest growth in Europe last year, when it also celebrated the abolition of its deficit. The recovery started just in time for the 2010 Swedish election, in which the Conservatives were re-elected for the first time in history.

I can’t explain the feeling with words, but I’ve tried my best (‘;
Here I go,
Beware of “the cares of this world . . .” (Mark 4:19). They are the very things that produce the wrong attitudes in our soul. It is incredible what enormous power there is in simple things to distract our attention away from God. Refuse to be swamped by “the cares of this world.” Another thing that distracts us is our passion for vindication. St. Augustine prayed, “O Lord, deliver me from this lust of always vindicating myself.” Such a need for constant vindication destroys our soul’s faith in God. Don’t say, “I must explain myself,” or, “I must get people to understand.” Our Lord never explained anything— He left the misunderstandings or misconceptions of others to correct themselves.

By 10 o’clock that night I could barely stand with all the muscle aches, head ache, nausea, and fever. My breath was coming out in spurts. I was burning up but freezing. BFE finally talked me into going to an urgent care facility. Naturally, by the time I said ok, they were all closed early because it was Sunday (does this make sense to ANYONE??? People still get sick on Sundays. So confused.). We stopped at a Walgreens so he could buy a thermometer and really check how high my temperature was.Turned out I was at a blazing 104 degrees. So straight to the Celebration Hospital ER we went.

This song was the b-side of the "Valley Girl" single. First of all, imagine all the kids who bought the 45 and, just out of curiosity, gave this one a spin. Second, it's a fitting flip-side, representing a girl on the opposite end of the economic spectrum as the Valley Girl. While the airhead from Encino is a homophobic, shallow little wench, the portrait of the Teen-Age Prostitute is a sad one: a girl who ran away from an apathetic father to help her penniless mother, now living with an abusive pimp who keeps her loaded on drugs as she walks the streets at night. It isn't a fun read.

This is perhaps the key point that authors should be aware of. The author still has to provide his or her own cover image, with stock images coming at an addition cost. For a book intended as ‘a book for family and friends’ and without distribution, this does not seem good value, though, it could be argued that an author might be happy with supplying their own images. Still, it seems to stretch what the interpretation of ‘a custom designed cover’ actually is. To other author solution service companies—this would mean an in-house designed cover with the author not being required to supply images.

The group was founded in Scotland in the mid 1960′s. At that time, the band was known as “The Saxons“. Seeking a less Scottish sounding name, they allegedly got their new name by throwing a dart at a map of The United States. Supposedly, the dart landed in Arkansas, and not wanting to be known as “The Arkansas Rollers”, the band threw a second dart, with that one landing on the town of “Bay City, Michigan“.

When I think back to the years of myself as a teeny tiny person, I never thought of my family as being out of the ordinary by any means. We moved to the US when I was three from Taiwan and lived briefly in a quaint ocean side town in the NE. We spoke Chinese, ate rice with almost every meal, used chopsticks, stayed close. When the local paper printed a picture of me during the annual town Easter egg hunt, it never occurred to me that it may have had to do with me looking different from all the other kids who were participating.

It is a beautiful morning here in Bellevue, Nebraska. I saw a woodpecker climbing on an oak tree outside my kitchen window this morning. The clouds are covering every inch of space that tree limbs can’t cover. Jazz music is playing through the speakers around my desk. Kat Edmonson’s voice sweetly serenades me into a state that is somewhat between being catatonic and overly vivacious. My father’s house smells somewhat of garlic, butter, and a touch of musk–all of which make for the most pleasant odor a teenager could ever want to smell like. The people in this house have hardly made a noise this morning, except for the occasional floor board creek, paw scratch, or back door opening and someone lighting a cigarette.
Henceforth they have become known as the “gold-plated pickles”, which I treat myself to once a month or so and which LC craves from afar, since she can’t get them in Boston. Despite my continued willingness to shell out for these, however, I have wondered periodically if I couldn’t produce something comparable at home. After all, what are pickles? They’re cucumbers, in brine, with flavoring.

But as the jets near the UFO all of the other jets in the squadron find their engines mysteriously disabled. They have no choice but to break off. Yet Maki’s jet remains unaffected. He alone continues on course. As he nears the object, Maki can just barely make out its form, a ball of glowing red plasma streaking through the upper atmosphere at phenomenal speed. A moment after he sees the object, Maki blacks out.
These days though, we’re taught to expect the best, and the art of compromise has, by many people, been forgotten. “We’re worth it!” the ads tell us, and, “Don’t accept anything less than perfect.”

Through two hours and four rolls of paper towels, you stood by me as we soaked up that paint until the sun went down, literally. Together, we cleaned my car until no one could ever tell a trace of paint had fallen on that gray fabric. Oxy, I truly believe that if we can get through this, we can get through anything. Thank you for standing strong with me and still working though you've sat in that shed for so very long. Thank you for not poisoning me with toxic fumes, but most of all, Oxy, thank you for saving my marriage. Because had you not worked, I'm fairly certain Paul would have left me.

Just writing this, I'm thinking that I need an intervention. I still haven't finished Food Inc but what I did see was crazy convicting. More to come on that later.

I know what you're thinking, FatCat should have a lock on this title. I did finish a close second (not really) in the Beer Drinker of the Year sponsored by Wynkoop Brewing Company. It was a close battle but in the end J. Wilson edged out a win. The win was based largely on a gimmick in which Wilson fasted for 46 days on just water and dopplebock during lent. I mean that's what FatCat calls summer break, I don't see how that is an accomplishment. Wilson is a fellow beer blogger at brewvana.net, a homebrewer, and a beer judge. He has also published a book about his fasting experience, Diary of a part-time Monk. The other two finalists were Warren Manteiro and Greg Nowatzki. For the prize Wilson wins free beer for life at the Wynkoop Brewing Company, $250 worth of beer at El Bait Shop in Des Moines, Iowa, and appropriate clothing identifying him as the 2012 Beerdrinker of the Year.
One more thing I realized was that in iaido (and kendo) and karate is that you never want to be flat footed. I suspect this is true of every martial art. You want to push your intent forward and don't give ground unless you want them to have it.

My family didn’t have the money that the other families at that school had, so my clothes were never as nice as the other kids clothes, which I’ve already told you about. I didn’t get to go on ski outings and stuff like that that the other kids did. Or go to the movies, unless friends took me.

Saturday was leisurely as well. A little "antique" store and fabric store perusing before we headed to the museum district. After a tour of the museums last year shortly after moving here, I've been holding off on revisiting so as to have a visitor-friendly destination just in case. We only managed to get to the Menil main building and the Cy Twombly annex (I'm not a fan) before rain sent us scurrying. We ate a nice Thai dinner and then returned to my place for whatever we're calling disco naps now. I guess we were all exhausted because the disco naps turned into sleeping all night.
Anyways, to celebrate the occasion (OK I know 25 is not a ton but giveaways are fun and I haven't done one in a while!) I'm going to be giving away one of my Chubby Cheeks Collection Headbands!

Last year I had a bit of a health scare - won't tell you the mind-numbing details - suffice it to say that I had to lose weight or else. So I made myself exercise for half an hour everyday. Sometimes I thought, do more, lose more calories! So I did an extra 10 or 15 minutes. But doing the extra made me too exhausted to write, or cook my nutritious meals or do anything. And the last slice of cake in the fridge? It ended up in a place where cakes shouldn't reach. Extra time turned out to be fattening.

If there is any type of “war” going on it’s the new anti-men movement. To the ladies waging this campaign against men, I’m begging you, please: drop your weapons. You are fighting a losing battle, and ultimately, you are harming yourself and the female gender. Regardless of your sexual orientation, you need men; you can’t live without men. Moreover, I believe a portion of your disdain for men stems from internal strife and discontent.
For those who have been without a partner and have deep longings for romantic companionship – someone to share life with and connect with on a soul to soul level, I am feeling your deep heart-yearnings and loneliness so strongly. Some of you are at a point of desperation or despair, or are isolating yourselves I feel. I am getting that if you are in such a predicament, take great care of yourself, put on some lipstick and jazz yourself up. I’m getting that keeping your faith is vital and will help carry you through. Slowly you will start to feel better and not so empty, lost or sad. They are showing flowers on the horizon. The angels will shower you with rainbow healing light for your love life, all you need to do is ask.

Midterm, Part I
so today is fathers day.....what a shitty day. Last night I did not sleep like at all 7 am rolled around and I was still awake. So I did have a small snooze and went to a family gathering. Of which my oldest daughter did not attend. She hates me. All those years of Jeff getting USP driving Ashton to school at 4 am, cleaning up her puke when she was sick, etc,etc. Jeff did all the things Ferd would not. Jeff stood up and took Ferd's place when Ferd couldn't me man enough. Only to have Ashton turn around and demand his insurance number, not even a happy fathers day. Then I call to say sorry for somethings I said a few weeks ago and I get blasted. Where is my daughter where is that wonderful caring girl I raised? When do I get her back. Instead of this person who is totally brain washed by someone who really most her life didn't give a rip. If he really had cared then he would not have spent her childhood taking her to car shows and hanging with dope heads. He would have done kid things. But alas none of that matters because I'm an F***ing B***** who does not deserve to have children.

I have the POWER to do so through the Divine Will of God that lives within me.

But really, the magazine is aimed at people who can’t get online or who may not frequent the internet often, maybe that’s the magazines main target audience and if that’s the case, the six pounds is justified as is the demo disc of old demos. It isn’t offensive reading material either, but it isn’t anything which is going to be memorable, it is quirk free, no-nonsense official. And that’s what it is meant to be.

For example, the other day I was signing a sheet of sticky labels at top speed (the labels were to put in the books of kids who'd forgotten to bring in their money but still wanted to buy one, and the speed was because I was up to the wire in terms of catching the train home) and someone leaned over my shoulder and said in a slightly disappointed tone, "Oh. I can read your signature." And it's true. I'm legible. How boring.
We met on Sunday and we knew it was a good fit. Glen has a strong, witty spirit and a calm, assertive energy. He made us laugh, we all teared up, and that was that.
New Year was also spent with my sister and her daughter and children. We all saw the New Year in together, toasting with glasses of wine and juice. It was great fun to have the kids around as they are so entertaining, especially when up late as they get second wind.

The Quip's use of djembe is definitely a mood setter that puts the band apart from others, but they've certainly got a lot of other things going for them as well. Personally I was particularly happy about the reply to the second question - already they've successfully showed quite a variety within the styles they loosely confess to and it makes me really curious about the range of awesomeness they can accomplish in the future. Most definitely a band to keep an ear open for!

It was the first time I said it out loud and the first time I let myself realize that the reason for my "silence" is a simple truth-- fear. It sounded sheepish when I said it. It sounds silly even as I type it, and I can't help feeling embarrassed, but keeping it to myself eased the anxiety. If nobody knows, then I can't be too devastated if nobody shows up. If nobody knows, then writing even one order will be a victory. Then there's the matter of people liking my designs and styling, what if I can't pull it off to my own standards? I mean, I think most companies have their own team of designers and stylists to plan out each vignette, some working 6 months in advance to complete a showroom. (I've only been in business 8!) Although I have more support than I could ever ask for and be grateful for, it's more of a DIY operation, and how exactly are you supposed to style a space with just 6 bar carts and 8 chairs? I was terrified that it would look like a game of drunken musical chairs. Fun for sure ;), but definitely not first impression material.

Looking back I find it almost impossible to remember when or how. Fairytales will have come first, and I read a lot of the Brothers Grimm and Asbjørnsen & Moe, as well as H C Andersen. They were far ‘bigger’ in Sweden than any Greek or Norse myths. Thor doing his stuff, being angry up in the sky was a fun idea, but totally implausible to me. Icarus flying too close to the sun was probably read to us in primary school, but again, I felt it was a tall story, if you’ll excuse the pun.

Over the years I can honestly say that I wasn't a crafter dictated by the season until I turned my craft love into a business. Before, I made whatever I wanted, whenever, and in whatever color suited my fancy. (I have to admit though that back then I was mostly making baby blankets.) But when I became an official business, I started trying to "keep up" with the times. Just like clothing stores. If you expect to have fall items ready at the brink of fall, you make them a season ahead. Is this easy? No, because frankly, I'm not wired that way.

In February 1982, the struggle reached its climax in Sunni-dominated Hama. Seeking to end the rebellion, Assad massacred the Sunni population of the city, killing as many as 20,000 residents. Alawites blamed the Muslim Brotherhood for the disaster, largely convinced that Sunnis had and would always reject their efforts to integrate. Even liberal Alawites, who criticized Assad’s aggressiveness at the outset of the revolt, remained silent in the aftermath of the Hama massacre. They had been transformed from victims into perpetrators.

What might happen in the real world is that a copyright holder might tell a middleman, such as YouTube or Twitter, about an offending video or an offending link. The middleman would then immediately take it down – not wait until it had confirmed that a breach of copyright had actually taken place. Because of SOPA the middleman would act quickly, fearing that its entire domain could be taken offline. It seems to me that SOPA giving this kind of muscle to copyright holders is not such a bad thing.

This reference was clearly intended to leave the viewer with the impression that these racist attacks were being perpetrated by those same “white Australians”, if that was not his intention, why make such a reference?.

Suddenly we are in the fleeting, magical fortnight or so when every day brings more trees into leaf, more startling green to the landscape. Every day the view from my bedroom window is different. The tawny mass of the distant beechwood has washes of green in it today: errant sycamores, perhaps, ahead of the beeches. The horse chestnuts have proper little leaflets hanging from them now and even the silhouettes of the oaks are thickening with fat buds. White blossom is beginning to star the geans; the cherries have decked themselves in their frilly pink party clothes. My only problem for a Tuesday tree post, then, is which to choose.

Healthy crowd on hand tonight for what is probably the best fight card we’ve ever had. Excited for a big night of fights. The crowd is ready to go, and we’re prepared to start our amateur card right at 6 (a little early – but necessary to fit in the 13 total fights we have scheduled for tonight).
Chunks of sweet mango are tossed with creamy avocado, tomato and cilantro. This is a dish that gets better with time. As it sits, the juice seems to multiply. Whenever we make it, I find myself putting it on everything we make throughout the week. But it’s not just a topping. It definitely can be served as a dip on its own. Cinco de Mayo is in a few days. Tortilla chips are necessary. So come on over, I’m out back…with a Corona. I have one for you too. I promise.

Take out the center rectangle, punch a hole and add a chipboard gear, washer, and hitch fastener creating a doorknob.
I refused to participate. The instructor, disappointed and possibly angry, said "you're going to have to kill something sometime." I rolled my eyes. I stepped outside to avoid ridicule and realized that many of the male fish lying on the ground were still alive. I told one of the hatchery workers and he came out and half-heartedly clubbed one again. It was still moving. While it may have just been postmortem nerve reflexes, it still unsettled me so I spent the next hour cutting the heads off the fish as they were tossed out the window to ensure they were dead rather than have them suffocate to death. The knife they gave me was dull and it took all my strength to cut through.
The Captain scarcely heard, running blindly into the heat, to collapse outside the walls of the kasbah. The heat shimmered and danced while two drops of blood welled on his wrist, shining like the eyes of a spider. They found him there in the morning, his wrist in his mouth. The teeth were in deep.

But, more importantly, it begs the question: “Who had the clearance necessary to delete information from secure CIMS logs?”
I am definitely more of the latter than the former (why must my husband insist on throwing his watch and wallet in different places throughout the apartment every day?!) and have been looking for fun and functional trays to store and organize around our home. While trays can of course be used to beautifully present food, they can also be used to group and display items belonging to a certain category (e.g. a small every day tray could hold your watch and jewelry) or group items, like perfumes and beauty products, together. I like a polished look for the bedroom or bathroom while a sleek look (like the black tray below) could be used in my living/dining area all year round for displaying knicks and knacks elegantly or even treats like cupcakes! I use our floral Liberty of London tray in our kitchen for holding our breakfast treats and fresh fruit - the print is just too fun!

We were lying there on the floor when my daughter, Asena, decided to stand up and walk over me, her heel burrowing into my sensitive belly.
Everything happens for a reason. This isn’t always fun to live through. But hell if ain’t gonna make me stronger. I will not wait for someone to unlock me from this cage and remove my shackles. I will create the key and soar.

In some cases, especially early in his career, Luserke had been making appropriate payments to authors, but it appeared that he had mostly stopped after about 1990. While the problems with Heyne and Amber were fully corroborated, Luserke was also doing business in then-Czechoslovakia, Romania, and other European countries, and the extent of his thefts was never fully discovered. SFWA’s efforts to bring him to justice in Germany were impeded by the distances involved, and the case was dropped after my term as President was over.
Good morning everyone! Hope you're having a magnificent start to your Saturday!! I'm a little late in getting my post up this morning, so I apologize for that! It's time for a new challenge over at Kraftin' Kimmie's Challenge Blog, and this week our hostess with the mostest is the fabulous and awesomely talented Alice!! Alice makes the most amazing cards, and she has challenged us to a....are you ready????....a ONE LAYER CARD. Yup...you heard (or rather read) me correctly. LOL! A one layer card. Well anyone that has ever received (or maybe even weighed) one of my cards, knows how much of a challenge this was for me. But hey...isn't that what challenges are for? To stretch us out of our comfort zone? So I grabbed my cardstock and set out to do exactly that. And this is what I came up with.
Thank you to Amanda Williams Deputy Head who began and coordinated the project in this school and to everyone involved.

WACKY MISUNDERSTANDINGS
Inequality? Try this on for size: OWS protesters were swept up and jailed in cities all over America for the misdemeanor of stinking up the place and refusing to pack up their tents. Meanwhile, well-connected liberal Democrat Jon Corzine walks free and easy after "misplacing" billions of investor dollars. You can bet he's not nervously looking over his shoulder--Washington's got his back.
Here are the rankings for the month of September:
The dungeon is brilliant. I love the hydras and the grim riders although the latter always end up getting slaughtered because I use them a little too boldly and throw them at the enemy without backup.

Oh well. Won't be long and with daily mowing we hopefully will kill it off.
Now, if you look at this picture to the left, you can see what Addison looked like at week 13. I remember how she kept turning and hiding from the ultrasound. I remember how even though an ultrasound is more like a shadow, she looked like the shadow of a human being. She had arms and legs. Look at the picture, she even had lips and a nose. She was fully alive.
In Enchanted when Sunday Woodcutter encounters a charmed/cursed frog, she finds a friend. Sunday is the seventh daughter of a seventh daughter, and although she loves her family, she doesn't always understand their storied history, or her place with them. Sunday is a romantic who quickly finds herself falling for her frog, for Sunday knows that he was once a man, and wistfully aches to know that man. Sunday and Grumble (the frog) become fast friends and confidantes; with Grumble, Sunday has someone who wants to know her secrets and hear her writings, and someone she can trust. Grumble disappears one night, leaving the tender-hearted Sunday worse for the wear.

In the three years since then, over 10,000 unique visitors have stopped by to spend a little time here. That amazes me. Not because I think I'm uninteresting, but rather I am amazed by the sheer scope of reach my words have here. When I was doing my radio show in Richmond, VA, many years back, I don't think I reached 10,000 people! Certainly I didn't reach folks from so many varied locations. You've come to my blog from Spain, Japan, New Zealand, the UK, Sweden, Malaysia, Croatia and more other countries than I can list here. In fact, six of the seven continents have sent readers to this blog (only Antarctica remains - come on, where are my Antarctic readers?!?).
Pratyush: – I don’t know. I don’t know where our relationship is heading towards. At this stage, we both are giving time to each other to think about this relationship of two years. Initially she could not live without me but I was too careless to think about all this. Now she is getting busy to shape her career and our relationship is facing all this heads and tails.

But how can that be taught?
One other salient detail. The Guardian's headline calls Tacheles the "last stand of Berlin's bohemians," which is not only hyperbolic, but inadvertantly points out Tacheles' failure. Not to be too pedantic about it, but bohemianism is not a permanent state. It's a stage of development some people go through which may lead to a way of life, usually in the arts. But there's usually a point when each bohemian realizes that it's time to either get serious about their life-project or put on a suit and start looking for work. Tacheles' residents are bohemians, nothing more. They're not artists, no matter how many "galleries" of welded distorted shapes and weird photographs the place has. Bohemians, as residents of Montmartre and Greenwich Village know, are easy to sell to tourists. That keeps the tourists from disturbing the artists.
But mine….Hmmm. I’m torn between two, one of whom you met in Shattered Dreams, and one of whom you’ll meet in Broken Illusions: Julian Delacroix. Julian is introduced in chapter 1 as guru of all things metaphysical. He runs a New Age shop in the French Quarter, has long dark hair and deep-set eyes,has a mysterious room on the second floor of his shop, is the subject of many rumors, and does something for Trinity that makes her aunt very, very mad. Any tips or tricks for aspiring writers?

Spiritual communities, though potential havens, can also become escapes for the socially challenged. And teachers from other cultures, though masters in their spiritual disciplines, may lack the experience they need within their new culture to give realistic counsel to their students — and sometimes get distracted as they encounter the enticements of the West.
Cassie, you are talking to yourself again. And with an accent this time too.
The economic damage was far in excess of the trillion dollar plus immediate loss of life and property. Tens of millions developed cancers. The dollar had to be devalued 50% at a hastily convened G-20 Finance Ministers meeting in England on the weekend of September 22nd and 23rd . The devaluation of the dollar had been planned for soon after the 2012 election. The devaluation doubled prices which is to say it cut purchasing power in half. Fifteen million Americans were turned away from Food Stamp offices around America between the fourth of July and the end of the year. The 49 million Food Stamp recipients complained they only got enough food to last the first two weeks of the month. Food riots and random violence became endemic to American cities. Attempts to ration food were unsuccessful because the government had no food to offer and had lost control of the population within 3 weeks of last 2 quakes.

MOG lets you play through the Roku at the $4.99 subscription price, but Rdio requires the $9.99 sub. But when you think you get nearly all new music for $9.99 a month, that’s a fantastic deal.

Naturally this series of unfortunate events have driven me to a state of deep existential angst, where my primal desires for something real, a sense of community and probably sex have made me become disenfranchised with society. What shall I do? Listening to the Safety Dance at ear damaging levels, growing my hair long and frequently procrastinating have only lead to several appointments with the local doctor and the quiet disdain of some of my teachers. I must do something more drastic. I must form a gang.
My sister and I have a meeting tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m. with the Vice Principal who called my niece in (without a parent's presence!)and advised her that she could be suspended for bullying! We're going in, informed, calm, cool, and collected and require that ALL parties be reprimanded and called to task for their behavior. We'll also be pointing out the Phoebe Prince case and ask that they take the matter seriously. (If we have to).

They are fift h, a point behind Newcastle and Tottenham and, even though they will end this season with their lowest points total of the Abramovich era even if they win all three of their remaining league matches, reaching the top four would be regarded as a triumph given the turmoil that the club appeared to be in when Di Matteo took charge in March following the departure of André Villas-Boas.
I watched it all when it was on (and before you begin adding on your fingers, I'll help ... 1st season: 1982). And so did Tom. But we'd forgotten so much. And it is like a stage play. A really well done, clever stage play.
Was awesome, like usual. Thanks ladies for coming.
As a music consultant, I push to the artists I work with to dress to success, hype up the strengths but also let others see you for what they want on a higher level. For example, if you have a run of 3 dates a week for a full month and you are putting out there that you are listing your schedule for the month, that is a very impressive schedule. Now if you go and do the same thing and name it a tour, it is ok and while it might impress some friends and fans, the industry and industry folk, might actually see it as weak.

This month as summer wanes our Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has given us much to think about. Tapped phone conversations - how vulgar - leading to greater vulgarities still. Young prostitutes whom he did or not pay for sex. Women in a line outside of his chamber, women seeking fame on his tits-and-arse TV stations from a lover who boasts: 'I govern this country in my spare time.'

Slipping up and telling your Japanese friend (you DO have one, don’t you?) that you need to buy the world (せけん）and not soap（せっけん）takes a couple of seconds, yet the embarrassment you feel when you are corrected will sear the lesson into your brain and you will NEVER make that mistake again. How long would you have to sit there with flash cards repeating these to words to force yourself to remember them otherwise? Too long. And whose to say you won’t forget them anyway?

This feeling started almost immediately after Deacon's surgery. I guess it technically started in the hospital - on day 2. When I felt like Deacon was replaced with a "new" baby (http://sweetleighmama.blogspot.com/2011/12/surgery-craniosynostosis-repair-day-2.html). And it lasted until about a month ago - the end of January. But the strange thing is - I never realized it was postpartum depression until recently. While I was in the throes of it, it never once dawned on me that what I was feeling was depression. It was only once I began to spiral out of it that I realized what had been going on. I knew I wasn't myself. I knew something was wrong. But I couldn't put my finger on what it was. All I could tell people was that, "I just don't feel right."

In May 2004, the European Commission warned the sixteen organisations that collect royalties on behalf of music authors that their so-called "Santiago Agreement" is potentially in breach of European Union competition rules. The purpose of the agreement was to allow each of the participating societies to grant to online commercial users "one-stop shop" copyright licenses which include the music repertoires of all societies and which are valid in all their territories. The structure put in place by the parties to the Agreement results in commercial users being limited in their choice to the monopolistic collecting society established in their own Member State.
Our school is unique in that we are located on the campus of our local state university. Our building is an old one, celebrating it's 100th anniversary this year so it is with it's limitations. For one thing, we do not have a gym in our building, so each gym day we load the kids onto a shuttle bus and drive them to the college's gym down the street. The kids love the bus ride, they think it's cool.

Hmm, apparently this was such an off-the-cuff loaf that I didn't bother to make a note of either the ingredients or the method.

Again, subject to the exact questions asked, can it be shown he had contacted, or even knew of Mulcaire? The mysteriously re-appearing emails (more of which later) might assist regarding that point. Mr Mulcaire would of course be a compellable witness in any perjury proceedings. Whilst he failed to appear at the Sheridan trial, as a result of medically certificated ill health, one can imagine he would definitely be asked to attend such proceedings as we are contemplating here.
The cost to the hard pressed tax payer to keep him in 3 star accommodation with free television, gym and, as near as dammit, private medical and dental care, plus when released state benefits. We should send more foreign criminals back to where they came from and then spend the money we save on more deserving people. The old and young injured servicemen and women returning from the wars. I wonder if he will be sending his friends in Searchlight and the church the odd postcard whilst sunning himself in Mauritius.
Though heavy on sculpture, the exhibit also features a smorgasbord of 2-D work. Vanessa Pastore & Don Seiple offer up a selection of their intensely creepy digital photo-manipulations, German illustrator Rainer F. Engel presents an entire wall of beautifully rendered illustration with subjects spanning Vincent Price to the Golem, & Andy P. (aka. Black Unicorn Studio) threatens to traumatize optic nerves with his bold melding of screen printed color & detailed line art. Rounding out this already large line up is the work of two more Connecticut artists: David Grant offers up several stunning examples of both his sculpture & illustration work & Joe Wilson is sure to turn heads with his highly refined digital paintings.
Oops, y'all! We dropped the ball and just now found out that one of our super cute couples, Whitney and Gene, was featured on Glamour & Grace back in September! Their rustic, DIY-style wedding is one you won't want to miss (assuming you hadn't already seen it, unlike us).

In the 1960s, during Powell’s two tours in Vietnam, he never joined with other U.S. military officers who risked their careers to warn their superiors about the brutal and self-defeating strategies that, eventually, ended up costing the lives of 58,000 Americans and millions of Indochinese.

There are 58 officially designated national parks in the United States and its dependent areas, however, there is only one in the northeastern United States - Acadia National Park on Mt.

Next time I'm in NYC, or traveling anywhere for that matter, I'll try to meet up with more of my "online" friends. Tweeting and emailing is great and all, but I can't really share a glass of wine with my computer screen. And unlike avatars, I like how a person can smile back at me.

Montreal-based Canadian progressive gem...side 1 includes only one long(19'54")track entitled "Mann Made" , which is very interesting,mixing progressive,classical and elctronic music with spooky and dreamy organ passages,acidy guitarleads,flute solos,harsh vocals...side 2 except "Keep On Moving" ,which utilises fast rhythms with horns and synthesizers contains more slow and melodic moments like "Country Company" and "Reflections" with a hypnotic mood... "Carnival" is a strong mid-tempo ballad,sounding like a combination of Tim Buckley and Tim Hardin, but with also harsh vocals...the cut called "Evolution" ,which is the album's highlight,features good rhythm and stunning lead guitar work with several similarities to Pink Floyd's music...

The Notebook, was his first book ever published and is now the well known movie that every female adores. Basically, this book tells the story of a couple. The story is told on two levels – one is the present day when Allie and Noah have grown old and live in a home; the other is the story Noah reads from the notebook in which he tells how he and Allie met, fell in love, lost each other, and then found each other again. Allie is then diagnosed with Alzheimer’s and she completely forgets everything, including their meeting. Though she does not remember, Noah tells her the story of their love every day, hoping that she will, one day.

Desensitization surrounding rape and sexual abuse seems to continuously invade our lives – it’s in the TV shows and movies we watch, in the songs we listen to and it’s even woven into every day speech as if it weren’t a horrifying crime that affects millions of women and men in the U.S. alone. While some may think that a rape joke is harmless or a TV show graphically depicting a sexual assault is just interesting television, the prevalence and normalization of sexual violence in our daily lives has very serious consequences. Namely, it furthers the perpetuation of a culture of violence and rape in which the sexual objectification and dominance of women is just the norm.

I fully expected to be working in movies within a year of moving to LA.That was not my reality and it is not the reality of most people who move to LA to pursue acting.It can take a very, very, very long time to succeed in this business and my best piece of advice is to not give up.You have to motivate yourself and just keep going.Create projects for yourself.Don’t whine.The first year is the hardest followed by every anniversary up to about year 5 when you’re so beaten down you don’t notice the years passing anymore.I have a friend who is so incredibly talented it is a crime that after 10 years in LA he still has to wait tables to make a living.He gets acting work here and there but he can’t hold down an agent.This business is not fair.It is not like other businesses where if you show up, and work above and beyond everyones expectations, you are pretty much guaranteed to move up the ladder.I don’t know why it works out for some and not for others.And when you move here you have no idea which camp you are going to fall into.
My car is 11 years old and I’m saving for a new one, but hey I haven’t had a car payment in 6 years and I have NO debts besides the usual; rent, ulitilities and food. I have money in the bank. I get three checks a month to stay home and NOT work…like I said I’m retired and I worked hard for 39 years to have what I have. I have a pension, a annuity (that’s that saving account called 401) and Social Security. I am now on Medicaid part A and a full SENIOR CITIZEN and I have and get many benefits. Life is good.
Of the remaining 540 known survivors it is estimated that not more than 100 were seamen required to man the boats. This would leave approximately 440, and: in the ordinary proportions of women and children in the steerage, where passengers in the Titanic's care numbered 710, it seems probable that the greater part of these 440 were women and their little ones.

This morning my ex-father-in-law died. To say “my” in relation to him almost seems fraudulent, really, because I haven’t been in touch with my ex-in-laws for several years, and so can’t claim them as “my” anything. There was a falling out, rooted mainly, as best as I can figure, in the fact that I moved on so thoroughly and completely with my life after their son, my first husband, died.

Smelled like cumin and curry with a hint of coconut. Really strong cumin smell. I like cumin, but it was still a bit off putting as it's not a smell normally associated with a beer. Luckily, the flavor wasn't dominated by the cumin but instead by coconut with some chocolate and roast from the base stout. There was a little hint of lime and the finish had some cumin in it but at that point it blended well with the rest unlike the nose. As I drank more, my lips started tingling a bit which was a result of the cayenne pepper in the beer. It's not something you notice flavor wise as there's no spiciness, but it still manages to make its presence known.

Several senior CDU Merkel allies, including Wolfgang Bosbach, a former champion of European integration, are expected to vote against the EFSF expansion proposal in the Bundestag later today. And lenders to ClubMed are rock-solid in their unwillingness to take debt write-offs above 21%. Both these eventualities were predicted in the Slog’s post yesterday, which used leaks from an anonymous German banking source. The source’s confidence in the passage of the EFSF legislation also seems to be justified.
On Saturday, Zi, her fairy godmother Auntie Tracy and I drove to Yara River. Zi loved the cold water and was doubtlessly in her element. I just felt good. We stayed until she started to shiver and the tide began to rise, and then we drove home. Of course, to do this trip on Saturday required doing nothing on Friday, Sunday and Monday. Seriously, I think I expended whatever I had in me for the long weekend on just that one trip. I was so spent, I let all kinds of things slide, just handed the baby over to Lyndon to bathe and entertain, left the dishes for him to wash, heaped the unfolded clothes on a chair, didn’t make the bed, and relegated everything else to that place where unnoticed things go, even if I noticed them.

Are these parents responsible for their son's behavior? Of course not. They have two other daughters and a son, all of whom are hardworking responsible citizens like their parents. Bobby was raised in the same environment, attended the same schools, and was treated the same way as his siblings. Why has he turned out so differently from his brother and sisters?

The models show oil hitting Florida's Atlantic coast within a few weeks, then moving north as far as about Cape Hatteras, N.C., before heading east.One question I haven't seen answered is: at what level of dispersion is the oil no longer harmful? I assume that if a hundred million gallons were distributed evenly throughout the world's oceans, it wouldn't even be noticeable, and would biodegrade in no time. But somewhere between that, and the actual conditions we have - giant plumes and enormous sheens concentrated in the northern Gulf of Mexico - is the threshhold beyond which dispersion takes care of the problem. I don't know what that threshhold is - whether, for instance, the quantities shown swirling about in the mid-Atlantic in this animation would still be dangerous to ecosystems. At the least, though, this looks bad for pretty much the entire coast of Florida.
Cally's come a long way in her writing career, and at the moment life is really hectic. 'There’s a lot to juggle,' she says. 'I have a day job, I’m promoting “Home for Christmas”, a short story anthology called ‘Tears and Laughter and Happy Ever After’ that I’m involved with and I’m putting together a synopsis for novel 3. Oh yes, and there’s another novel that I’ve been working on (20,000 words written so far) that I’ve had to put on the back burner since giving birth to my first child at the beginning of October! If the press report a huge rise in coffee sales in Bristol you’ll know why!'
Last Thursday, during the team meeting, the boss requested to clear the annual leave before end of the year, and she does not accept the under table deal request to carry forward the leave.

In this first draft I’m using my somewhat sarcastic “all-knowing” narrative voice but I really should be in the characters voice as this narrative is an extension of the characters thoughts. The character here being a Puerto Rican New Yorker drug dealer reflecting on the recent actions of one of his soldiers. So I changed it to this:
We have had a very fun, long weekend! It started with a sleep over at Gram and Gramp's on Thursday night. All four kidos! John and I enjoyed a kidless, date night. Something we aren't very good at. I dropped the kids off, then went and got a haircut. We had dinner at Javier's, then went to a session at the Bountiful Temple. It was so nice to enjoy the night together, and not worry about getting back to the kids. The best part was knowing they were having the time of their lives, and not missing us a bit! The next morning we even enjoyed sleeping in (a bit), then John went to work and I enjoyed breakfast with a friend. I went to get the kids about 11, and they were far from ready to go home! I don't know that they were even excited to see me. Gram was spoiling them, and they had an agenda of things to do before going home. We had lunch, pulled a sled behind the 4-wheeler, cut out Cole's pinewood derby car, played some more, and finally headed for home around 3. Drew had a long nap, and we had a fun night. Gram let us borrow Home Alone 3 (they watched 1 AND 2 at their house), which they couldn't wait to see! They were all ready for bed when it was time. Cole and John had a sleep over upstairs, Cole was VERY happy!

So here goes…I have melanoma. I had a new mole last May that I chalked up to a pregnancy granuloma which is completely common and completely normal. I did not think much about it until I started back to work this year and noticed when I cut it shaving that it had gotten significantly raised and wouldn’t stop bleeding. I was still lazy about getting it removed because I was busy with work, the kids, getting into a new groove, I didn’t know a good dermatologist. A whole bunch of crap excuses. Partly, I was afraid. I am a nurse, I am not stupid, and I knew the thing was WRONG!
Watched New Year's Eve today, which makes me pretty excited for New Year's, I think my outfit is sorted now so that's good! I feel like I should make some resolutions or something, but I never stick to them! Have you got any?

Some of us grew up as athletes, amongst thin, athletic, small-breasted women and grew to like different physical traits than most guys. Like the tight calves of a runner. Or the strong thighs of a skier. Or the muscular stomach of a volleyball player. Maybe we know that having an athletic woman at your side means being more likely to live an adventurous and daring life. (Not just in the outdoors, but in the bedroom, too…)

Yesterday evening, I sat for a while, watching Nathan's fingers dart quickly over the keyboard of my laptop as he wrote another of the pieces that keep us returning again and again to his blog. I sat for a while playing scrabble with Kelly, watching her cleverly crafting interlocking words from the most basic of letters. And as I did, I thought of another ritual that had once felt so comforting then somehow turned into a chore.

NOTE 3: I4i Chairman Loudon Owen stated to Bloomberg News that Microsoft’s argument has a “simplistic appeal” that “does not take into consideration at all what the patent office actually does . . . What it’s going to result in is tremendous uncertainty for anyone who owns a patent . . . It would be a sea change in the operations of the patent office and would be a dramatic body blow to the health of the U.S. patent industry and the value of patents.”

Perhaps it has something to do with an exaggerated sense of diplomacy. Inherent in the give and take of energy is a kind of aggressive / submissive implication that maybe some people aren't comfortable with. So instead they utilize a very p.c. approach where it is encouraged that neither partner encroach on the others' self-sufficiency, at least to the degree to which it is possible to be unobtrusive. I think this may stem from our cultural ideal of individuality and self-reliance. And also, perhaps a heightened sensitivity to the notion of equality of the sexes and a subsequent aversion to well-defined "masculine" and "feminine" roles. And that aversion also seems to imply an aversion to the emotional character of the dance, the desire between man and woman (or between same sexes for those with that inclination), which results in a dance that may certainly be expressive and beautiful, but emotionally inert. But perhaps this is a line of thought that is veering off on a tangent from the topic of this post.

The Hunger Games trilogy has some fairly graphic violence, so I would be careful about letting a child under the age of eleven read it. However, there's so much benefit in this book, that parents should just use discretion. If you've got a good reader at home who is nine or ten, and you think he or she can handle some death and violence, let them read. Otherwise, there's no limit on who might enjoy these novels.

New comparisons of pottery assemblages from the Marianas and the Philippines give strong support that Harvey and Ronald may have the same ancestors. Ronald’s forefathers travel 2,300 kms of open ocean to reach the Marianas most probably from the Northern Philippines - an epic voyage which is probably the longest during that time (between 1500 and 1400 BC). Putting it in the world’s timeline, the travel happened during the Late Bronze age when the Shang dynasty was ruling China, and the Hettite empire was reaching its height.

What’s wrong with me?
My husband was in the dining room watching some old western movie. I'm in the office. The rooms are on the same floor, but not visible to each other. I find myself listening to the music playing in the background of the movie. It's easier to do when you can't see the pictures. Before the electronic world evolved, producers used music to capture the "mood" of a scene. Old movies are filled with elaboratly composed songs - some even with words - and fabulous symphonic pieces. The notes roar or creep into the background, only to sneak away, unnoticed, when the acting takes center stage. Imagine being a studio musician and being given a movie score to perform. How disjointed and odd it must have been to perform without knowing the context of the scene where it would be used. How much music and song wound up on the cutting room floor. What talented musicians went unrecognized for their unbelievable performances in so many movies.

Man is by nature an inquisitive being, and when there’s nothing exiting going on in their lives they will soon find something fascinating to occupy and entertain their minds with. Our primitive ancestors also displayed these exact same qualities, hence when night time came, they looked for other activities to keep themselves busy. Besides storytelling around fires, and the natural pleasures of sexual indulgence with the madam, man must have also speculated how to improve their calendars, and/or astronomical observatories. “Come guys, let’s study that group of twinkling stars up there, and see if we cannot incorporate them somehow into our dreary lives; maybe we’ll discover something new!”

A little over ten years ago an interesting research study relating to the application of hypnotherapy in the treatment of colitis was published which did not receive much publicity. It was a controlled study involving 266 patients which found that hypnotherapy and psychotherapy techniques can significantly improve the results obtained through conventional treatment of colitis (i.e.. drugs, diet and surgery.) the researchers found that many chronic diarrhoeal disorders such as colitis and crohn’s disease are very much influenced by stress and emotional conflicts (e.g.. depression, mental lability and anorexia), and they found that dealing with those stresses and anxieties through hypnotherapy and psychotherapy resulted in significant improvements in the conditions of the patients. Whilst the researchers did not suggest that these mind therapies should substitute other forms of treatment, they did demonstrate that psychotherapy and hypnotherapy could augment the effects of other therapies and should be considered for patients suffering from colitis and associated diseases who do not respond well to conventional treat.

I think I will take a break then and the next day will take some time to prepare myself for the next semester.

I know this may come as a surprise, as it did to me, but these little people in my house, the small, sometimes extremely loud, extremely smelly ones actually grow. I should know this. I have pencil marks, lines with dates and names smudged next to them, on my wall in the hallway near the laundry room documenting their growth. I watch them, everyday, shove gobs and gobs of food down their mouths in order to fuel their growth. Every time I dress them I notice that the space between the hem of their pants and the top of their shoes gets a bit wider.

Perjury, to be clear, is, in the law of Scotland, the making of false statements under oath, the statements having to be competent evidence in the case in which they were made, and material to the subject of the case or investigation. There requires to be proof beyond reasonable doubt that the statement or statements are false and that they are made wilfully and there requires to be evidence from at least two sources.
The investigation will be progressed expeditiously and in close liaison with the Area Procurator Fiscal and Crown Counsel. Significant resources will be deployed though these will vary with the needs of the investigation.
The joy of long exposure is the way in which moving elements either disappear (they don’t stay long enough in one place for the light they reflect to register on the sensor) or, if repetitive or slow moving, become blurred. Here, while the beach and the mountains behind are static and remain relatively sharp (sadly the gusting wind meant that a little fuzziness crept in to the frame), you can see that the clouds have streaked into long wispy things, and the sea has mellowed out into a soupy azure mist.

The trail is pretty uneventful. It wanders through moist areas where creeks cross (or are part of) the trail, and up through drier, piney ridges as well. From Abrams Creek campground up to Cane Gap the trail is interspersed with short rises and flat spots. Despite the heat of the day it was fairly cool (but quite humid) along the trail. Along the way we stopped at Campsite #1 where we stayed last year for Duncan's first backpacking trip.

No, I do not think the blow to James Harden’s head knocks them down on this list at all. I am hopeful that he is going to bounce back just fine from the injury. However, OKC has other issues. Russell Westbrook is playing just poorly enough recently to make us all think that he might not be the best partner to pair with Kevin Durant again. In the month of April, Westbrook is shooting 38% from the floor. In the last five games he is 25-82 (30.5%) from the floor. Not exactly the numbers you want to see from your second option, especially when his shot selection indicates a first option mentality. Having said all of that, the Thunder have maybe the most talented roster top to bottom. They certainly have grown over the past couple years. Something just tells me that they are still a year away from knocking down the next two teams on our list…

So yeah... I woke up after a bad nights rest. Sick. Tired. Not sleeping well. Afraid to sleep too soundly for fear of throwing up. I didn't, so that was good at least. But I did eventually wake up.
In 1951 Woody was tapped to be the 19th coach of Ohio State. The next years would bring success not like anyone had ever dreamed of. It wasn’t until 1954 that the first of the successful years began with a perfect season of 10 and 0 with a trip to the Rose Bowl. Sure there were ups and downs in any program but Coach was able to keep proving himself. I was a glint in my parents eye and have learned a lot of history by what I have read doing research for this piece.

Each of the small towns had a large church. Sometimes somewhat incongruous in its grandness in a very humble setting, but still a moving testament to the piety of the original white settlers. Found a town. Build a church.

As our tour guide was telling us this portion of the story, my mind wandered a bit and I wondered…If someone came to my house 1,000 years from now and, for some reason, there were still discernible artifacts among the rubble, what would people find? And maybe more important, what would they think of me because of what they found? Admittedly, I don’t have a bunch of amazing things in my home, but it really is the more day to day “stuff” that tells people how you lived. Books, music, family photos, computers, kitchen tools…what would my “stuff” say about me? What would they think was important to me?

Fenugreek is frequently used in the production of flavoring for artificial maple syrups. The taste of toasted fenugreek, like cumin, is additionally based on substituted pyrazines. By itself, fenugreek has a bitter taste.
As I mentioned to briefly in last post I actually sat in one of those plastic one piece lawn chairs. At the circus you could “upgrade” your ticket for $2 and get ring side. I sat in the bleachers for a long while and saw an empty chair right in the front row… just under the 300 pound mark I decided on courage instead of fear. During the show I was concerned as it wasn’t feeling totally rock stable but it held with no crack or bang or anything.

And I woke up in the cruising community—and we had rides to shore, and offers of loner dinghies, and suggested ideas, and a lead on a dinghy that belonged to another Canadian cruising family who was done their trip and ready to trade a dinghy for a car. And the dinghy had the exact motor on it that we planned to eventually buy and it was only one year old, and the dinghy was also fairly new and in good shape. So we rented a ute and went to meet our new dinghy—and its family, SV Monkey Feet. And a deal was struck and Monkey Feet was happy to see

This seems like simple common sense to me, but when you get sick, sometimes that just goes right out the window. I’m not proud of it, but I clearly remember leaving screaming messages on a former nephrologist’s answering machine when he would not call me back about surgery I was having in just two days. (I finally had the surgeon call him.) Yes, he was an incredibly arrogant person who had no respect for me, but did it help that I treated him – shall we say – less than respectfully, too? Answer: Nope, it just helped my self- respect fly out the window.

The immediate pain will eventually fade. Just as when my father died, there was terrible pain for me. I wanted to pick up the phone and call him, but I knew I couldn’t. I wanted one last time, for old times’ sake, but I couldn’t. I flashed back to all the good times, but they were not to be any more. I believe that feeling may be something similar you must experience to live on. Your old life must die and there will be tremendous pain with that death. Each day you will want, just one more time. Time may heal all wounds but sometimes the scars are there forever.

So Adrian finished up where he could and as we were waiting for the rain to cease (again I know!) he packed up and set off to his next job. We let him go knowing that we might not be able to get him back should we need him but that’s the risk we are having to take. He wasn’t able to move forward at the pace he was used to as we needed to pause and wait for the electrics to get done and they would be at least another week and well you can’t pay someone to have time to wait .

Strength: Royce White is one of the best all-around players in the nation. Not many talk about him, but he can score, pass, and rebound with the best of them. Head Coach Fred Hoiberg has done an excellent job of surrounding him with talented players leading to a suprising season. White is largely responsible and he is going to be a nightmare to matchup with in the Big Dance.

I have been watching The Voice ever since the beginning of last season. We are now in the semi-finals of season two. For those who don’t watch it, the show has a really cool concept. At the beginning when each artists sing for the four mentors/ team leaders (Adam Levine, Christina Aguilera, Cee Lo Green and Blake Shelton) the four can’t see what they look like! This way, the artists are only being picked by their vocal ability and not on how they look. This season each team had 12 artists on it, and now they are down to the final two on each team. The mentors will give each artist a rating and everyone can vote from home (online, by phone or by buying the songs on itunes) and tomorrow night they will announce which one person from each team will go to the finals next week. When the winner is announced, they get a record deal and the title of The Voice.

Envy was on full display at the topless pool, also in terms of ordering the most bottle service, being the most sexually provocative in the pool, and doing the most outlandish poses poolside. I wondered how the security staff and lifeguards of this pool (all of three feet deep at the deep end) must feel after working this post after a while. I think I’d go nuts. I couldn’t do it. The fact that people work in this sort of atmosphere day in and day out for months and years on end reveals how divorced we have become (as a generalization about modern people) from our divine heritage, or simply from the spirituality behind our sexuality. There is nothing but base, exagerrated, ego-driven displays of tawdriness here. I am sure I could catch some flack for this, but I don’t find it sexy at all.

The same kind of propaganda found in Nazi antisemitic literature makes a return in "An Education" but at a more subtle level. This is how a negative political ideology works: it takes a group and dehumanises them by substituting negative characteristics for their essential humanity. Whatever goes wrong it is they who did it and people can retaliate without conscience because they do not share our humanity.

Shipula admits that, finally, after throwing smoke. He says all he wants is a level playing field. But that's not going to happen with the maze-like provisions of the Pennsylvania Liquor Code, where the MBDAPA apparently found reason to argue that if Sheetz doesn't want to sell on-premise, they can't sell off-premise. This ignores Appleby's, of course, which does sell on-premise but chooses not to sell off-premise, as do many, if not the majority of Pennsylvania's restaurants with liquor licenses.
Prior to heading out to Chicago, I'd read other stories of the surgery - particularly Trisha's and Jaded's - and had very specific ideas about what to expect. None of them truly prepared me for the excruciating pain. I don't think that it's possible to really wrap your head around it unless you're actually experiencing it. I was also expecting a ton of waiting and it to be loud and busy and crazy, but since I was the first surgery of the day, it was the opposite. Yes, we had to check in at 6am, which meant waking up at 5am, but it was well worth it. We didn't have to really wait at all, and everything proceeded on time. Highly recommended to get that slot if you can swing it.
This recipe is a good example of this type of harmony. I read a recipe for orange glazed fish and thought it would make a great Extreme Vegan Makeover. It combines my love for spicy Cajun seasoning with Tom’s love of sweet, fruity marmalade. I don’t usually like foods that are glazed but here the spice and sweet are a marriage made in heaven.

When you coupon, you often have to get more than you need. A deal might consist of buy one get one free or a coupon may say that you have to buy a certain amount to get the money off.

Writing courses have been helpful to me because I’ve learned more about craft. I also have benefitted from valuable feedback and learned what works and doesn’t by reading others’ work in critique groups. Learning how to give and receive constructive criticism is invaluable. The creative process is often so personal, it takes effort and practice to separate the written work from yourself.

The thought froze me solid in the middle of the bush; did I really think the large feline that had crawled through these bushes minutes ago was the same cat that had been mine as a child? The same Sophie who had slept curled on my bed every night until...I....left? Is that how I had come to be in this place? I started to move forward again, if I stopped to ponder these strange thoughts, I would lose track of Sophie.

I remember walking in the fields of ripe sugar cane with dad and watching with awe the making of jaggery and fresh molasses. The taste of soft fresh jaggery and rab (molasses) is unforgettable. He took me to see how the oil was extracted from mustard seeds. In the middle of a room there used to be a Kolhu. At the bottom, it had a hole to collect oil. It the middle it had a very heavy wooden rod. The rod pressed the mustard seeds against the wall of the Kolhu. This rod was linked by another piece of wood placed on the neck of a bull. As the bull went around in circle, the seeds were pressed to extract oil. After the oil was extracted, the empty cake of mustard seeds was mixed with the feed for dairy cows or water buffalos. For a six-year-old it was nothing short of a visit to wonderland. We would walk among the fields of gold (the yellow flowing mustard fields) and come across a rahaat or water wheel (Persian wheel) powered by a buffalo or a bull. The cold clear water would bring the village kids to bathe and play there. Sometimes the farmers or weary travelers would sit there to rest on charpais (wooden cots weaved with ropes) placed under shady trees.

I almost guarantee that not every single Ephesian had abandoned their first love, but Christ did not single out individuals in this letter. It is addressed to the church in Ephesus, and it calls for all to repent and change their ways. This passage made me wonder about collective responsibility within a community. If an individual within a church knows of some corruption or wrongdoing within the establishment and does nothing about it, does not confront in brotherly love, just lets it slide, are they just as responsible as the person or people “in the wrong?” I’m not sure I want to know the answer to this question either.

I turned up on the first day in full school uniform, one of only two boys wearing a cap. The other was called Cheeseman. I was assigned to the same class as Cheeseman and sat next to him as the seating plan was alphabetical. Two little boys with two little caps. It breaks my heart to think of the naivety of it and the potential for piss-taking. But this was a nice school. Bullies were few and far between and didn't pick on me for some time. I settled into certain classes with ease. English, maths and French. Everything else, I hated.

For it has to be admitted: the stewed prune was conscripted by the regiment of women who knew “what's best for you” and had seized on the bowel as their territory. These enforcers– the nurse, the nanny, the sports mistress, the hair-netted dinner lady – took charge of your insides with a noxious mix of no-nonsense affect and shaming euphemism. Accompanied by the whiff of disinfectant, brusque insinuations of “regularity” and “movements” turned the poor prune into a purgative.

Of course now its deemed legal, teams can either formally protest it or adopt it themselves. Doing the the latter is possible for most teams, as they have apertures in the footwell area to fit a snorkel, while the shark fin and rear wing are easily created. But, finding a route for the duct out of the tub might prove the headache, as the monocoque may not have any openings sufficiently large enough. This year the monocoque is also is subject to homologation and hence cannot be altered until the 2011 season. Of course ‘where there’s a will, there’s a way’, teams will not want to lose a straight line speed advantage.

The daughter that was gone the longest, lives on the other side of the US from her mother. It doesn't surprise me in the least. There was an irreconcilable divide that happened, in a large part because of the mother's inability to see outside of herself and to look deeply into her children.

Both my son and I have worked as “trouble-shooters” for electronics equipment. So last night, after watching yet another news report about the strange problems plaguing Toyota automobiles, we got into a discussion about how difficult it is to solve problems that are hard to re-create. This in turn, reminded me of a TV documentary I’d seen about the problems that plagued the de Havilland Comet Airliner. You need to take a quick look at that page in order for the rest of this post to make sense.

Additionally, Butler and his partners (who include Goldman Sachs and the guys who brought you the Toren) plan to set aside some space for good times. Writes the Journal, "one section of the property will be used for cultural events and another section will have a food and beer hall that will feature food vendors from the Brooklyn Flea, a flea market held on weekends in Fort Greene and Williamsburg. Mr. Butler envisions that the 9,000-square-foot food hall will have five or six different food vendors."

So basically the US site is a single-minded drill-down system that lets you instead look at "all recordings" at any point, whereas the EU site thinks you might prefer "all recordings" but gives you a cumbersome option of using the drill-down system. In other words ArkivMusic has decided to partially hide its USP in favour of something that looks much clunkier than most of its competitors.

Japanese knotweed is at its tastiest when it's just begun to sprout and is still flexible at a stage where it's called "wild rhubarb" (in Vermont, early to mid May), otherwise the stalks become woody as they grow taller.

The country has been on fire all week in several ways, but the most important issue has been Cheryl Miller. A woman whose story affected many because it hit home just how vulnerable we are to the whims and fancy of any state body that wishes to abuse its power. The ease with which Cheryl Miller was locked up, the ease with which her family were denied their right to their own kin, the ease with which the authorities justified their actions and the ease with which they are now twisting the story away from their abuse of rights and inability to follow protocol and instead making it about whether Cheryl Miller is mentally ill or not is not just disgusting, it is downright scary.

Henry Thomas—who often recorded under the name “Ragtime Texas” was born in 1874 in Big Sandy, Texas. Given Thomas’ age, we can be pretty sure that he was around to witness the development of the blues from whatever its ultimate sources were, & he is often referred to as a “songster,” meaning that he didn’t specialize in blues, but played in a number of genres. Of course, that’s deceptive, because there’s strong evidence that many early musicians who we think of as playing blues exclusively also played widely in other genres too, but when it came time to record, they were mostly encouraged to draw from their blues repertoire.

Now in verse 32 our story continues. “Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.” They foiled the plan of the shipmen having believed the words of Paul, “Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.” It was a drastic measure, cutting away the only lifeboat, but the centurion believed the words of Paul.

Until this last week when TACOM (Tank and Automotive Command) sends out a message that "Polymer Magazines are not authorized for use on the M4/M16 series rifle" and I kid you not I read the message myself.

But then again neither is a "ghetto grip" or "grip pod" or "bipod."
Have you ever taken a closet inventory and wanted to scream? Not your spiritual closet, let’s not go that deep just yet. I’m talking about your clothes closet. While helping a client recently, I could see how she felt tied to her past. The longer we worked on getting her closet organized, the more I came to realize that she was deeply attached to her stuff. God revealed to me that the reason for her sadness was due to her recent downsizing. She hadn’t fully accepted that her new home was not as grand and spacious as before. She seemed desperate to go back to what she felt was better times. I saw in her the same common denominator among many who have too much stuff. She couldn’t get excited about her new closet, because she was stuck trying to hold on to the past. So it is with many Christian women who can’t get excited about what God is doing right now and in the future; they are too consumed with the past.
Note the hybrid power plant also recovers some of the kinetic energy of the vehicle, by letting this KE drive an electrical generator (during braking). The electrical energy is stored in the batteries. (Normally, this KE is dissipated as heat in the brakes.) An inverter is used to convert DC electricity from the batteries to AC electricity needed by the electric motor and created by the generator.

In all his public life, through the preaching of the Gospel and miraculous signs, Jesus proclaimed the goodness and mercy of the Father towards man. This mission reached its culmination on Golgotha, where the crucified Christ revealed the face of God, so that man, contemplating the Cross, might be able to recognize the fullness of love. The sacrifice of Calvary is mysteriously anticipated in the Last Supper, when Jesus, sharing with the Twelve the bread and wine, transforms them into his body and his blood, which shortly after he would offer as immolated Lamb. The Eucharist is the memorial of the Death and Resurrection of Jesus Christ, of his love to the end for each one of us, memorial that He willed to entrust to the Church so that it would be celebrated throughout the centuries. According to the meaning of the Hebrew word “zakar,” the “memorial” is not simply the memory of something that happened in the past, but a celebration which actualizes that event, so as to reproduce its salvific force and efficacy. Thus, “the sacrifice that Christ offered to the Father, once and for all, on the Cross in favor of humanity, is rendered present and actual” (Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church, No. 280). Dear brothers and sisters, in our time the word sacrifice is not liked, rather it seems to belong to other times and to another way of understanding life. However, properly understood, it is and remains fundamental, because it reveals to us with what love God loves us in Christ….
Okay I know, manipulatives can be a pain! Having to pull them out and sort it before the lesson, training the students how to use them, and then clean up. It seems like it's so not worth the hassle when you look at the picture in front of you. However, if you were to look at the big picture, manipulatives are a key asset to any true comprehension in math.
Dawn took up the challenge by using part of a box her hubbys new shirt came in! The card, the image & ticket were printed on scraps from her scrap box & has a dp printed on the other side! The beanstalk layer was once part of a room spray box, and the button was recycled from a jacket. Well done Dawn! This card looks amazing!

Certainly people in the S and M community know that the threshold between physical pain and sexual pleasure is finite. The closer one gets to that threshold the more blurred the line becomes and the less one cares where it is. I have learned this last week that the same applies to emotional pain and erotic pleasure. Sex has been off the table for me for many days since this tragedy in our family. A hiatus of weeks with no mmo and no partner sex is very unusual for me. But in all fairness I wasn’t in the mood. But there was a turn of events that set the stage for J and I to seek the solace of sharing sexual passion as a means to try and put the world sight and seek ways to strengthen our relationship to get through this time.
Most scientists believe Earth collided with a hypothetical, Mars-sized planet called Theia early in its existence, and the resulting smash-up produced a disc of magma orbiting our planet that later coalesced to form the moon. This is called the giant impact hypothesis. Computer models indicate that, for the collision to remain consistent with the laws of physics, at least 40% of the magma would have had to come from Theia.

You can view Matheny’s job in a similar way to how you may view the job of whatever poor guy gets stuck playing shortstop for the Yankees once Jeter retires. The shoes Matheny needs to fill are ones that Shaq would have a hard time filling. Tony La Russa’s managerial career in St. Louis spanned sixteen years and owns a total 1408-1182 record in those years, giving him a winning percentage of .544. La Russa is the longest tenured manager in Cardinals history and his retirement ultimately ended an era of greatness in St. Louis.

My day began early, awaking around 6 am in order to leave by 7 for an appointment at the Honda dealer to get the car serviced. I drive an hour to the best Honda service place around, and it’s worth it. I’ve said before that I have one that’s 20 minutes away, but I don’t like them, I don’t trust them, and after two chances at having me as a customer, they had an epic fail and I was done with them.
I read her words whilst waiting for the disastrous private appointment I had on Monday. “We can never escape the pain of our pasts, or the flashbacks that assault us when we dare to let our thoughts drift unattended, but we can choose to not let it ruin the future we, alone, can build for ourselves,” Kenyon writes. I am taking those words very much to heart.

I know the accident, losing Mom, made everyone sad for such a long time. Pops did his best to try to make things as normal as he could without Mom there. He made our lunches with us at night, letting us pick out what we wanted, just like she used to do. He did everything he could to keep things the same as possible, always trying to be happy… but every now and then Jack or I would walk past his room and hear him sobbing. At first, it really scared Jack, but Uncle Oud sat down with us one afternoon before Pops came home and explained, ‘You know how you really miss your Mom, well, your Pops really misses her too. Sometimes, when you’re the Pops, you just have to go in your room and miss her. Sometimes when things remind him of her, or her laugh, or when one of their favorite songs plays on the radio… He misses her a lot and just needs to take some time by himself, just like you do. And it’s always okay to miss someone when they are not here anymore.’ Uncle Howard had stayed with us for almost six months after he got out of the hospital. Pops said he needed family around to help him get better. They had even brought in the special bed for him, like the ones at the hospital, like the one Jack was sleeping in tonight. It all seemed so normal for Uncle Howard to stay with us; after all, he was there almost every day before the accident. He would stop by after work to see his ‘big sis’ or he would bring steaks for Pops to cook on the grill and corn and we would all have a picnic in the back yard for dinner.
And in this process, enlightenment happens. I’ve got some clearer ideas as to how I’ll proceed when the rain stops and I’m out again. I have a vision for the next buildings.

By opting to REMOVE all rights to negative freedoms like porn or red light districts from all other Americans, what you get is a PROTESTANT Ayatollah or Grand Mufti in Xian guise. There are already 3 Popes and 1 English Archbishop, the spirit of Protestantism wouldn’t even make room for morality based ‘edicts like this much less this ‘harmonize differences’ between differing sects and Santorum wants to impose these morality slanted views on porn on everyone else in a secular democratic government? What was suggested, could only be from someone who has a Theocracy in mind.

In a questionable grip on reality, the president recounted the ‘extraordinary’ growth of country’s military budget since 9/11 as he acknowledged that “global responsibilities demand leadership, the defense budget will still be larger than it was toward the end of the Bush administration.” Obama went on to make the prediction that the American people will “accept a defense budget” that ‘continues to be larger than roughly the next ten countries combined.” As the news networks almost entirely allowed the implications of DSG to slide under the radar neglecting to inform the American public of the president’s generosity regarding his new military strategy, the average American taxpayer remains unaware of Obama’s future foreign policy objectives and its consequences for social programs that millions of Americans rely on. Nor has the American taxpayer benefited from a presidential explanation of how a budget ‘larger than it was’ will affect the country’s fragile economic stability.
I started karate at 15 years old after a friend said it was great. 13 years later I've just acheived a 3rd Dan Black belt and the friend left 11 years ago! I'm not a very physical or sporty person which makes my acheivement extra special, for me anyway. I'm not the best in the class by a long shot but I don't compete with other people. I know that sounds strange coming from someone doing martial arts but there it is. I'm the highest graded female in the club and one of only 3 who have been there more than 10 years.

Mario and I have always been late night mallers and we really tend to over-stay mostly due to taking the last movie sched on the list. Oftentimes we’d see the long queue at French Baker wondering what it was for. I thought people were probably just meeting up folks there and made FB (French Baker) their landmark. I know that guess is off so I also thought it was because of the end-of-day sale (EOD sale) but I set that thought aside since I didn’t expect people to start to line-up a few minutes past 9PM for an EOD sale at 10PM.
The ostensible reason for the investor excitement is the company’s acquisition in February of Healthcare Distributions Specialists LLC, which the company describes as a “value-added distributor of hard-to-find and specialty drugs.”

When my boys were at the age of playing these games, I would play with them. Sneaking around the outside of the house and pinging them with a Nerf dart weapon/dart gun/or stick that becomes a gun; it is truly exhilarating. As I write this I feel that spark still.
Triple strawberry fantasy certainly makes our eyes widen when it lands on our table. It's a bright red concoction of shaved ice drenched in strawberry syrup, crowned with a scoop of strawberry ice cream and surrounded by fresh strawberry halves. Globs of strawberry jam and rivers of evaporated milk make this a sweet and icy cold finish.
OK I was just 1/2 awake in bed last night, couldn't quite get to sleep, so I turned the TV on. It was 10:00, my normal bedtime since the dogs have been waking me at around 6 am these days. There was a show on about couponing, yes coupons, those paper things that come in the newspaper on Sunday. Actually the show, I think, was called "Extreme Couponing".

After researching a bit into this topic, I found out that another researcher put down the foundation stones of my question – what are the cultural differences in general? This researcher was named Geert Hofstede, and his research experiments that he did with IBM employees ties perfectly well into how these cultural differences are played out online. Overall, there are allegedly six binary categories in which societies fall towards one or the other spectrum. If you would like to read more on this, ask me for the PDF file.

As the story goes, some of the Google employees didn't like having to walk all the way to the sidewalk along Charleston Road to get from the main Googleplex campus to the buildings on the other side of Permanente Creek (the three buildings that were the former location of ALZA, a pharmaceutical corporation). So, someone set up a zip line between the two sections of the campus. This was fun and dandy until the city found out about it then the zip line came down and people had to hoof it (my words, not Scott's) on the sidewalk once again... But only until the construction of the Google Gate Bridge was completed.
There is an e-book I think you can benefit from called: “The Little Book of Big Change-Be Happy, Make Money and Lose Weight” by Matt Beclcher. Here is the link to it: http://astore.amazon.com/self-help5300-20/detail/B004IK94A0

Interesting enough even though in most things I'm extremely tidy and organized (and my studio usually reflects this) my art is generally messy - splatters, drips, frayed, torn, large swaths of cheesecloth hanging off the edge. So style? Probably contained chaos.
Nothing was explicitly said, but I got the feeling that their mom had always been strong-willed. They'd picked up the knowledge somewhere that morphine could cause confusion, especially in older folks. That's true, but she hadn't received any for a whole day. Could be lingering medication effects, could be not enough quality sleep, could be after effects of being on a heart bypass machine during surgery which can cause memory loss and confusion. They thanked me for my patience and headed off to a very early breakfast. I went back in to find her asleep again. Excellent.

But then Barrionuevo’s biases begin to reveal themselves in much more obvious ways. He devotes the bulk of the article to criticism of Cristina’s failings without any mention of her accomplishments in education, poverty reduction, or human rights, and he describes her in unnecessarily harsh terms. (When he says that “with her emotional speeches and designer suits, Mrs. Kirchner appealed to the masses,” one senses that Barrionuevo isn’t complimenting Cristina’s oratory or her fashion sense.)

The result of the FCA has been to help create a thriving underground market in illegal guns. On the streets, a small pistol can be bought for 25 U.S. dollars, or an AK-47 for 100 U.S. dollars. In contrast, a legal gun costs about 500-625 U.S. dollars, plus more than 125 U.S. dollars for fees and mandatory training.

Grant got another promotion. YAY!!! He now works at the corporate office in Idaho Falls, and he L-O-V-E-S his job! So much so that we're considering not doing law school anymore. He's still going to take the LSAT, and he's still keeping up that GPA, but we love it here, so why would we leave such a love fest? I never thought Idaho would be our forever home, but I really can't see us leaving anytime soon.

Historically, most of the people who apply for the permit are those who make use of brew-on-premises businesses, like Brewers Apprentice in Freehold, or Brew Your Own Bottle, in Westmont. And with good reason: Brew-on-premises operations are sitting ducks for enforcement, and the owners risk their businesses by not having patrons sign up for the permit before making beer at their sites.

Words are often abbreviated to two syllables and end in "y". So, Stradebroke Island becomes "Straddy", Breakfast is "Brekky", and Barbecue is "Barby". Sometimes word are just completely different, like "Pram" is a baby carriage and "Chooks" are chickens. The following photo is the local Salvation Army resale shop.... notice the name. ;-)
One last note about the cost.... this project cost less than a comparably sized dresser ($249)and toy storage ($176) from Ikea, and far less than furniture from somewhere a little swankier like Pottery Barn Kids or Crate and Barrel. And the bonus is... no lost floor space in the nursery, which is not huge to begin with. Even though $350 sounds like a lot for a closet, it isn't a lot when you think of what you don't have to buy and the floor space you don't have to lose.

My livelihood depends on the need of marketers to get closer to their customers and use their input to help them develop more effective ideas. So, in advocating that marketers spend more time thinking like people, am I a turkey voting for Christmas? I don’t think so. While I genuinely feel there are cases when research is conducted where it is simply not needed, the best outcome of marketers remembering they are people too would be better quality ideas. A greater proportion of the ideas that we put into strategic development research would at least be potentially right, rather than half of them being totally wrong. This in turn would enable us to spend more time gaining useful feedback and developing promising ideas rather than wasting time separating wheat from chaff. A higher initial strike rate is going into the project will give us a better chance of a high quality idea coming out at the end of the research.

“We rehearsed that play last year in Drama Club. I played Penelope back then because I was the only girl who could remember all the poems and verses. She will never manage to do that. But I suppose all the parents will say how nice the princess looked and how nicely she played the role of princess. But if the poems aren’t recited properly it ruins the whole story… And she’s got a lisp!”
I've recently happened upon some advice that self-publishers need to stop blogging about self-publishing, and instead have an author's blog. Guilty as charged. But not for long. Check out my new blog at www.harmonylit.wordpress.com. Plans for this blog include weekly short story fiction posts featuring characters from the Akasha Series, sample reads, guest author posts, resources for readers and of course plenty of polls, contests and giveaways.
It is common for Christians to reference the foremost activity and action of God as giving gifts to humanity. Particularly as we see God's gift in the face of His Son Jesus.

We were able to call one another on occasion, but phone calls were expensive. He was going to A School at Great Lakes in IL and lived in a barracks. I lived in a dorm and had a phone in my room. His phone was in a hallway, and was shared by all of the guys on that floor. When I called, I would have to tell the person who answered who I wanted to talk to and they would go to see if he was in his room or in someone else's room on the floor. The minutes added up!

This can be very frustrating for anyone, especially people with such an independence like our Marissa. The therapist just asked that people make sure to work with her. This time will take pateience, practice, and understanding on everyone's part. If she ignores your texts and facebook posts- this isn't to be taken personal. Trust me, she is receiving an enormous amount of contact from people, and she just has to take responding one person at a time.
This one looks cute. Blu, the main bird, can't fly. He falls for a lovely bird, Jewel, that can. They happen to be in Rio which is not Blu's home. He's been kidnapped and wants to go back to Minnesota. But, he's got to fly to do so. Hilarity ensues. It looks like it will have both adult and child humor so that gives it a big bonus in my book. And for the kiddies, it's not just a mindless cartoon. Even from the trailer I can tell it's about finding yourself, not being afraid to take risks; basically it teaches a lesson while entertaining. Now isn't that sweet? My guess: 3-3.5 out of 5

Nazri Aziz is another ‘enemy’. But we treat each other with respect and when we met for dinner more than a year ago I sat beside him and we treated each other like old buddies. After dinner, we debated various issues in front of an audience of 80 or 90 ‘Old Boys’ of the MCKK. We of course disagreed on almost all the issues but we debated like gentlemen and addressed each other with nothing short of the highest respect. And this was no show. This was sincere and for real.
JJ: Yeah, there is so much craft in it, y’know?…At the same time, it brings you hard up against the distinction between craft and art; craft won’t get you all the way there. In the end, there’s a leap.
I'm still processing what this means, but it's put the scare in me. I mean, I'm continuing to live my life, working out full speed ahead and moving forward with plans to The Lake House, but I'm much more cautious, and more than a little nervous. Andrew is too, and he now insists on being by my side for ev.e.ry.thing. from running to taking out the garbage to Ohmygod, that was a contraction wasn't it? Are you okay? Can you hear me? Is there a foot hanging out?!
And of course to get another chance to read my work which I love to do more than almost anything else in the world.
John first met Casey one shadowy afternoon when he didn't get to the lunch van in time and was in need of someone to go and get him a sandwich. He would have asked his secretary, but she had been taken ill with one of those stomach bugs that was doing the rounds that autumn, so he went to his boss's secretary instead. He was shocked to see Casey behind Miranda's desk. Miranda, his boss's usual secretary, had retired last week. John didn't know. He never paid attention to people such as secretaries - they were more like animated machines to him - not really people - not really worth his time or attention.

So, today was day 1 and let me tell you that Jillian kicked my butt. Seriously. It was intense, hard and tiring. My body is WAY out of shape. By the time I was done I was drenched in so much sweat I couldn't sit anywhere and had to shower immediately. An hour and a half later my legs were still shaking.
So today I find myself wanting to spring clean my life in preparation for reaching the milestone of entry into a third decade. I am proud of lots of my achievements so far (most obviously my boys) but there are lots of niggling things that I have been procrastinating with.

We do many things that are motivated by fear, some that we are not ever aware of. If we fear anything but God, that motivation is sin and leads us away from God and into more to sin. The greater our sin, the greater our fear of his judgement.

The private spaces are defined by organic or curved volumes while the public spaces hold a more rectilinear and transparent character. The curved surfaces generate textures and shadows using traditional hand made Mexican brick as a lineal weave. These surfaces contrast with the glass and exposed concrete elements. The design sought a character made of continuous exercises of contrast: public vs. private, heavy vs. light, light vs. shadow; thus resulting in a contemporary expression of crafted materials.

My family and I drove to Connecticut from FL for a vacation last December. While we were there we went poking around the Goodwill Outlet store and found this wooden chair for only $0.99 (that's the price of a candy bar!!) I couldn't pass it up (along with some very vintage luggage), so our souvenir from our trip was this chair. And it sat in my craft room for 4 long months before I even looked in its direction. Until today.
I Can Do It! ¡Lo Puedo Hacer! Of course the first book I won was a children’s book, with zero description. I’m going to assume that it’s about a bi-lingual kid that can do a bunch of things, including running around in socks and a blanky cape. We’ll see what my kids think about it. I was a little annoyed at the PM I got from the author telling me to make sure I review it on goodreads and Amazon. Oh, and that she signed her name ‘Author,’ because I’m sure I would have just confused her for someone else who was asking me to review a book.
Her family - and all patients who battle cancer - continue to need prayers.
I reach for that bottle and its neck graces like a Gretsch. I snag the glass from the shelf and take my favored chair. My seat sits fine. My knee bends to help my boot heel the stretcher. The lid magically uncorks and the bottle tilts. Liquid pours forth vibrating glass with first notes. As sun hits my face I can’t help but watch it do-si-do through my glass. It dances, it prances, it giggles. It too hears the bourbon’s song.
He caps this reading off with a statement that seems, at first glance, to be not quite related. “Discernment is God’s call to intercession, never to fault finding.” All too often, discernment leads to gossip. Gossip becomes a “prayer request.” We must guard against this with all sobriety. In order to seriously intercede, we must be “completely and entirely identified with God’s interests in other lives.”

One last bit of business for the day was to reopen the fuel tank and do a little more cleaning with acetone (which really works). By the time I finished, cleaning up and sealing the tank, Kostas came by and we talked of things to do and I showed him my progress. Then I showed him a major question which dumbfounded him and is a good one for all of you. Why do I have a raw water (with sea-cock) input tee-ing in with the, above waterline, output of the electric bilge-pump??? Anyway, the evening proceeded with hanging out with Kosta and Paula and drinking raki and talking music.

According to someone who went to the Cambridge folk festival there were CDs for sale there by The FLK, but they didn't appear to be flying off the shelves and there doesn't seem to be any trace of it online. Is it a slow month in the FLK's marketing department (which I imagine as an office full of people wearing badger and pig masks, listening to slightly downbeat techno)?

Prince Paul (with De La) was to first to really make sophisticated ironic humor in hip hop (before that it was all “Pickin’ Boogers” Biz Markie humor... not that there’s anything unfunny about booger-pickin’ with Biz Markie). A friend of mine once argued that in the pantheon of concept albums, De La Soul is Dead is like the Beach Boys’ Pet Sounds. And Paul’s Prince Among Thieves is like Tommy. Your mileage may vary on that analogy, but it means SOMEONE SHOULD LET PAUL MAKE ANOTHER ALBUM.

That afternoon after school found me in my father’s office at the palace. I burst into his office without knocking and then flopped down on a chair. Interrupting a conversation between him and his top economic advisor, I complained, “Why do I have to study two foreign languages?

HaandBryggeriet IPA, also on tap, is an excellent IPA, very hop-rich, again with those distinctive toasted lemony notes, but this time wrapped in a sort of hempish mustiness. Again, it is not as overpowering in hop as Nøgne Ø IPA, and it’s not as dry, surely, but this has a good balance: it drives right up to the edge of too far, but it thankfully slams on the brakes just before it gets there.
But, in any event, the “war in heaven” is now reaching down to our planet, the Illuminati are about to be flushed down the toilet by the “God of Armies,” which some modern translations refer to HIM as.

Isn't this the story where Reed Richards defeats the would-be invaders by convincing them that comic book panels are photos of real-life monsters that inhabit the Earth - basically using the conceit that, to comic book characters, drawings look like photos?

No matter what happens in your life, some bad things will happen at times and you can do two things; sit there in the pain or stand up, face the issue and move on with your life. The moving on can be really hard for some people, they get stuck in the shame, guilt, pain, etc. for what ever happen. It’s hard to get up when something major happens, but believe me when I say this, the sun is shining bright somewhere for you to walk towards. There is always hope, no matter where you go.

And then Race Day was upon me. My husband and 3 of my 4 kids were travelling with me to Pacific grove, CA. My parents were in route too, from Merced, CA. All to watch me race and cheer me on. I wanted to throw up. On the drive there, I asked myself more than once, "what have you gotten yourself into??". Why the increased stress? Despite my Olympic Workout and ocean practice swim? I had discovered that I had only 4 hours and 45 minutes to complete the entire course . . . and my workout time was 4 hours and 41 minutes. I did not have much wiggle room. No room for a flat tire on the bike . . . no room for flipping over onto my back to rest on the swim . . . no margin for error.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank OWFI for giving me a scholarship to attend. The experience was more than I expected and the board did a great job organizing the entire event. The conference showed me what an invaluable resource OWFI is in pursuing a writing career. The support I fail to find elsewhere can be found here among others who understand me and my writing aspirations. I feel truly blessed in having found them. I connected and was welcomed by my local chapter the Norman Galaxy of Writers, even though I haven’t attended my first meeting yet. I look forward to sharing my writing travails with them.

On the up side, the Sun Up brew pub/restaurant was hopping when I dropped in around 1:00 PM to get the growler topped off. There was easy, casual banter going on between the wait staff and the clientele seated at the bar and the bar tendress indicated they were nearly out of the Nut Before Christmas Nut Brown, so I can only gather that business is good. Will I be back? Hell yes, I’ll be back! Who wouldn’t buy beer from a brewer named Uwe? (I went to high school with a dude named Uwe. You think? Nah.)

A problem we've been having with Faith is her digging holes. Both Freckles and Yoshi keep digging under the fences trying to get to her, and Faith tries to imitate them. We can't scold Freckles or Yoshi, but have to keep scolding Faith; her digging not only gets her dirty, but she might slip into the other lawns or hurt herself/have them hurt themselves. The fence separating her from Freckles is a rusty old gardening fence.

Now the jars are ready to go into my canner. You can see in this photo the three jars in front showing the three steps to putting the lids on. First make sure your jar rim is clean. Then put on the rubber gasket. Next place the white lid on top. Finally, put on the metal ring. Tighten as you normally would, then turn BACK a 1/4 turn. That is the only thing that was different about using these lids.

I think that eyesight is one of the best of our senses. It allows us to see the smile on a little child’s face as they play, the beautiful color of flowers in bloom, and the majesty of an eagle soaring in the sky.

I don’t remember feeling tired and yet about another thirty minutes later I was sound asleep. I didn’t wake until 8:30 – unbelievable! It was probably the most restful sleep I have had in a long while. I read some of the posts on my course page responding to the question of whether parents of youth offenders should be held criminally responsible for the action of their child and possibly even incarcerated. I thought a great deal about responsibility and how as a society we shy away from taking responsibility. Are we born knowing responsibility? Do we need to be taught about responsibility? How do we learn to live responsibly? As wonderful an instrument our brain is, is it flawed? It seems too easy to be hard wired for an irresponsible existence. Oh, so many thoughts and so few answers!

There's not much technical info on their website, but a Double IPA is always music to my senses. However, not in this case. Expecting a Double IPA in what seems to be the de facto American tradition, the aromas are quite muted, and I have to admit I transferred some to a snifter to try to concentrate them. What's there is pleasant, though, with a nose full of caramel, sweet mandarin peel, a pinch of nutmeg and floral undertones. On first taste, the body is is very pleasant, presenting a soft, chewy caramel base, cut with a lime-like freshness. The middle ground flies by rather swiftly (sorry!), flashing rounded pear, a little banana, to be replaced with a mildly sorbet-like finish that is sweet with long-lingering citrus notes and an edge of butterscotch. I have to admit, I was disappointed in not getting what I expected, but it's a decently-flavoured, moreish, easy-drinking beer.

1. Last weekend we went to a party. Nice people, some kids for ‘Timan’, good food and drinks, but most of all, good dance music. And this music (and probably the food and too much sugar) made ‘Timan’ hyper, he kept jumping and dancing, but all of a sudden running and running like a perpetuum mobile. He didn’t stop anymore. Eventually we had to leave and it took ages to calm the tot down afterwards. Even at home, it was around 11pm, he wanted to party and ‘run’ to the music. Oh, little one, dancing is perfectly ok, just skip the running, the only thing you do is knocking over other people.

That could’ve gotten USC the death penalty, but that wasn’t what happened so no death penalty. That was a given. But this?

JoNo has also had homework each night. Spelling and Math mostly. He loves it! It's quite surprising, really. He is in a special reading group because he is not on grade level for reading and last year, his spelling was HORRIBLE! But this past week, he only missed 2 words out of 16 on his pre-test. If he missed one or gets them all correct on his pre-test, then he gets the challenge list for the week instead. My poor reader is a good speller? Somewhere that doesn't make sense. But maybe that just means that the reading is about to jump up to grade level?
Moses assumed that the total responsibility of teaching, guiding and governing the Israelites fell on him. And so it is with many of us.
Architecture is something related to really material stuff. This because it is strongly linked on how the market goes. Once you try to put this kind of thinking, you are discussing about some really fundamental things of our society. I don’t think we can really overturn this, but I think it’s our duty to try to put – as we say in Italian – some grains in the gears, something which can produce some frictions, to make some slight perturbations in the system that could lead to some unpredictable consequences.

By breaking humans of this focus on ego, He will change their focus back to concentrating on Him, or they will cease to exist. He is accomplishing this by slowly removing the positive influence of the Holy Spirit on the world. Through the Holy Spirit, He provided favorable environment for humans to live on the earth. When the Holy Spirit is removed, the environment becomes unfavorable for humans (e.g. drought, fire, earthquakes, etc.).

The answer to where they are could be found last night at the Will Rogers Auditorium. Often at political events there is a sense of excitement, anticipation, a certain buzz in the audience while waiting for the main event. Excitement, anticipation and buzz are weak and inadequate words to describe the pre-rally crowd last night. Energy is even inadequate. What undulated through the thousands who thronged outside before the doors opened last night was a kinetic power, the power of hope, the power of liberation, the power of anger at a system turned upside down, the power of liberation and, yes, the ultimate and emancipating power of freedom. You had to be there to understand it.
Recently a Spanish translator asked me exactly what was meant by ‘pitch black’, as he understood it ‘pitch’ was a toss or throw, a place to play football, or a bid to sell something. It is then as you try to explain the allusion to road surfaces and tar and pitch that you realise yet again the infinite richness of our language. Then I set off on my regular morning website trawl, starting always with the wonderful Jeffrey Wells’ Hollywood Elsewhere. A glimpse or two at twitter and then usually a phone call to my closest friend, illustrator Mick Brownfield for our doubly procrastinating water cooler chat which might be, (invariably is) about an obscure British film of the 1950s, sections of which either of us have suddenly found on youtube. I might then add something to my blog. This is usually book related, and most likely connected to an aspect of illustration, decorative art, or the movies. I recently added a post about the Rex Whistler murals in the Tate Britain restaurant, and another on Clouds in Films.

So I'm sitting here eating a packet of "Squirtin' Skulls", a Halloween sweet I bought not because of the occasion but because they looked good. Remember those sweets you used to get that had some kind of gooey liquid sugar in the middle? Well, these were nothing like that. The skulls had no flavour and there almost no goo within. They were quite possibly the biggest waste of a pound, ever. Naturally, I'm being a little melodramatic when I say that but surely this is the time of year to over blow things? It is Halloween after all and what do most people do on Halloween? They get pished whilst wearing white sheets with eye holes in them.
In a nutshell, the Imago premise is this: we all emerge from childhood with “wounds”, along with an unconscious idealized image of our caregivers. As adults, this image (which psychologists term an “imago”) compels us to choose romantic partners resembling one or both of our parents. That is attraction. All going well, we will soon be daft with euphoria, because we believe we’re finally going to get what we didn’t get in childhood. (No, not the Sega mega-system. You will never get that.) This is romantic love. And marriage – well, that is where the real fun begins, because marriage is the arena in which you may heal childhood.

Yesterday, at our request, a representative from the Department of Agriculture came out to visit and test our chickens in conjunction with the National Poultry Improvement Program. NPIP is a voluntary program that provides testing for common ailments in home and commercial flocks. NPIP helps us to ensure a safe food supply and avoid the transfer of disease through other means (after all, taking care of chickens is not a hands-off activity here at the Flying T). In addition, it allows those who raise chickens to avoid unnecessary medicines and antibiotics. Finally, by working exclusively with NPIP-certified hatcheries and home producers, we can reduce the chances that our healthy flock is infected by birds or chicks we purchase as replacement stock.
As I have said before I add my pasta to the pan that has the sauce so that the last bit of cooking time is in the sauce. It allows the sauce to incorporate into the pasta itself making for a much more delicious result!

Writing is something I have always wanted to do—I wrote my first book when I was seven—but it wasn’t until I retired that I found the time to devote to it at a serious level. Even then it wasn’t quite as simple as knocking off a book in one go, for it took me over twenty drafts and
I think this is going to work pretty well for us. Thanks for making it one of the challenges, Toni!
He bent down and pulled out the ring, saying so fast the words all melted together into: wilyamaryme?

I bought this little cart at Walmart for around $13. It's the best purchase I've ever made. The kids can sort their own laundry, and it fits into the small space I have in the laundry room. I keep a laundry basket on the floor for towels.
And the buildings in which we inhabit seem permanently here. We cannot escape their shadows as we navigate from one interior to the next. The 21st century is littered with reminders of architectural decisions made remotely in the past: these are buildings by planners and architects with the most inhuman and obtuse of theories, and buildings from which we ought to, in many cases, recoil in embarassment and even depression. Our buildings, whether commercial or cannot so easily be escaped unless we opt out of modernity altogether and decide to live as anarcho-primitivists claim we should live.

This young woman also posted before pictures in which she is sporting zero body fat. She appears to be fit and mentions that the photos were snapped after a fitness class that she taught. She goes on to say that she has already noticed that her flat stomach is even flatter after a few days on the challenge. I can only assume she is aiming for a concave stomach.

I can stand at the foot of the cellar and look out towards the barn (or where it used to be) where I had so much fun as a child. I can hear grandma say, "Calvin! Will you get some fruit from the cellar."
You can’t believe that women have actually survived this and you never knew about it. Not really, anyway.

I went out on FMLA for 2 weeks, and have gone back to work on a reduced schedule. I talked to them about the Bipolar Disorder and they told me that when I don't feel like I can work, I need to take FMLA, not to come in. And if I do come in, I will be held responsible for whatever happens. If I had to work tonight, I don't know if I would be able to. My FMLA protects me from being fired for calling in, but it doesn't feel very good to take off work and leave the place short-staffed, it puts a lot of pressure on me.

Hmmm. What hotel? If they were allowing him Internet use, why wouldn’t he be able to make a collect telephone call? Who did he talk to at what embassy?
“You can?”

Here's an easy way to make the dirt: Bake the cupcakes as directed on the box (BTW, toss the mix that comes with the box. Blegh! Buy your favorite brand instead!) Next, with your fingers, gently pull the top off of the muffin. Pipe in a little chocolate frosting. Return the top to the flower pot - UPSIDE DOWN! Press into place. Perfect dirt every time! Add a gummy worm.
“Yeah, well, my middle name is my great-grandmother’s first name and my great-great-grandmother’s first name and my grandmother’s middle name. So I’m kinda named after all of them. But it is just one word.”
- Before I baked this, I checked out the experience of the TWD bakers, such as my friend Di (here's her post), and I learned that the filling tended to be dry and the crust browned quickly. Since I was baking my pie/cake in a dark silicone loaf pan and was using a new-to-me oven I reduced temperature to 350 degrees

I’ve come across odd encounters during the month of April. I actually have come across much of these things whenever I wander on streets. Anything I found out of place, odd and messy, I snap it. It’s also sometimes a great way escape from street photography with human in it. Scanning for human activities although had become part of my nature now. I can get tired especially after work, from whole day staring at computer screen.

There was much more that he said. Some of it was so new to my ears that I don't feel equipped to try to rewrite it here. And some of it didn't sit right with me, so I'm choosing not to repeat it here. It's my blog after all. :)

By comparison, the California Public Employees' Retirement System, the largest U.S. public pension with $234.8 billion of assets, has between 70 percent and 75 percent of the money it needs to cover future liabilities, according to Brad Pacheco, a spokesman. Calpers, as the fund is also known, cut its assumed rate of return to 7.5 percent from 7.75 percent March 14.
Granted,. this is not a new idea and has been around for years, but I dont see a lot of people offering these styles fairly consistantly. I adopted this technique years ago with many other skirts, pants, and dresses - and whoever I was inspired by (probably the Belgians in the 90's), we thank you!
Apply with sponge brushes your Distress inks. The ink does rub off, so I did take my ink pad and "rubbed" it in areas where it was going to need the most amount of coverage. If you missed places with the mod podge and you have areas where tissue is exposed and the ink hits, it will become darker and more noticeable compared to other areas on the shoe where its just "hinted" of color.
Thank you for stopping by! If you can’t let your chickens free range, or you want your chickens to help out in the garden, I highly recommend a chicken tractor. The really are handy to have on the urban farm.
In the few weeks that you've been on this earth, you've shown me that there is such a thing as unconditional love. You've made me realize how much I should appreciate my own mom, and I know she'll probably read this so we should thank her too. Without your gramma, there's no way I would be who I am today.

However, the dollar needn’t be the death knell for the non-resource segments of Canada’s economy. By playing their cards right, manufacturers can turn the higher currency into an advantage—or at least less of a hurdle.
I would love to hear your comments on your experiences of phonics with your preschoolers and young children?
As the ends of such a partnership cannot be obtained in many generations, it becomes a partnership not only between those who are living and those who are dead, but between those who are living and those who are dead, and those who are to be born.
which is often even better than the former life.
I'm trying not to get my hopes up because these things rarely work out but...IF we can make a fun trip out of a work trip, I'll definitely be figuring out how to squeeze a race in (5k/10k) so I can scratch a state off my list. Ideally, I would love to go to ATL so I can possibly hook up with two of my most favorite bloggers:

There is a plan to redevelop an old industrial estate in My Kind of Town into a massive housing development. It's sparked a lot of controversy, not least because of the jobs that will be lost to make way for shiny new homes. It will also mean a newly-emerged artistic and vintage quarter will be wiped out quicker than you can say restoration, restoration, restoration.
This being said, a few of you have told me you cannot comment on the blog itself... I am not a very blog savvy person, but here is my feeble attempt to give some instructions as to how to easily view/comment on the blog.
I just sat staring a the blood. I nearly fainted and just burst into tears. I couldn't believe that this could be happening to me again after all we had been through. I quickly went back to my desk and called Dr N and she told me to come straight in for a scan. I called my Mum as Hubby was working away and she met me at the hospital. Mum held my hand anxiously with reassuring words and I felt like I couldn't breathe.
Monday was the anniversary of my dad's death. Nine years ago. Stomach cancer.
Plot-wise this is a vast improvement upon the first volume, which had some serious pacing issues. And while the supernatural elements this time too turn out to be explicable through ordinary means, there aren't any of the abrupt tonal shifts that plagued the previous book -- once we find out the truth of what's going on, it doesn't get any less creepy.

I don’t eat me spinach and I’m not a man. But I am what I am. And I’m glad I’ve done what I’ve done. I took a long time to think about it. I took four years from the time I finally decided to do something about the dysphoria pushing me around all my life, until The Op. Four years trying to make sure that what I thought I wanted–to be a straight girl basically, and anatomically correct as far as the state of the art was capable of fashioning me–was what I really did want. That’s as much of an answer as I have to the question “how do I know?” Listen, listen, listen deep inside, pay attention to what you find, ask yourself again why you want what you are after. Try really hard not to shy away from the answers that resolve from the inky black of your Magic 8 Ball.
I don’t mean to suggest that this possible groundswell doesn’t favor Democrats, but that's only in places where they don't currently hold office AND there is an incumbent. All bets are off in races where the incumbent isn't running. This feels like the same simmering disappointment that turned into voter anger in both 1976 and 1980. And its roots are not just Iraq or worries about the economy. The general sense is that the country is foundering and people are wanting a clear direction.
No. I respond. He will be just fine. See ya' for dinner?
That more than anything, I am afraid. I am afraid that the people that I love in this world do not love me as much as I love them, that they CANNOT love me as much as I love them. The only exception to this rule has been my children, and in your death one of the only people on the planet that truly loved me died in my arms without ever having said hello.
I was there with my husband Richard and sister Jennifer. We heard some of our favorite musicans, like the Brass Band of California who are always lively, funny and accurate. (I got some tips about 1860s Music Hall traditions.) We also managed to catch Wylie and the Wild West and the Hot Club of Cowtown. I missed Sourdough Slim and his saw-playing sidekick, but Richard and Jennifer loved them.

Uncertainty for the markets generally means downside, a.k.a., the path of least resistance, and considering the massive crosscurrents only a strong ray of sunlight (QE3 here and abroad?) might save the day. That “sunlight” would glisten off of gold.
So many people are engrained with school that they can't see past it. Some say they respect home schooling, private school, charter schools etc...while still advocating public school.
I’m not sure about the long term viability of this show. I am perfectly ok with it having one, really good season. The premise is such that once some key plot issues are resolved, I can’t imagine it staying interesting. I wouldn’t mind getting the opportunity to watch the attempt however.
Instead Rachel loaded Sims 3. Maybe this would be the nudge Jessica needed to leave...a subtle hint that the visit needed to come to an end.

I will say travel. But I think I would travel to mostly Spanish speaking countries so that I could work on building my confidence in speaking Spanish. I love to travel and see different cultures and customs.
But finishing up, here are a few more images to drool over. Summer lovin’ indeed!
She shuddered; a cold shiv ran up her spine. Then there was a bump against the inside of the door and Lizzy’s heart stopped for a beat. It happened again, though softer the second time and Lizzy remembered to breath. There was a scuffle going on in there; a kidnapping perhaps. Or maybe someone was being murderlized.
What about this word “ever,” though? Is it a good word to use to describe the last few decades in Earth’s climate history? Well, if you like crazy, it’s a great word! Originally, climate science articles in newspapers and magazines were careful to state that the “third warmest year” was merely the third warmest in the modern record. And some articles do still draw that distinction. What seems to have led to widespread use of the word “ever,” though, was tired, drama-seeking headline writers (I’ve been there), putting the newspaper or magazine together late at night and needing to convey a lot of information in a small number of words. “2010 hottest ever during one climate agency’s century-and-a-half-long instrumental record” doesn’t make a top-shelf headline, not at all. “2010 ranked hottest year ever,” now you’re cooking with gas! That’s a headline. And headlines sell newspapers; they make people feel engaged.
So, how does this fit into the larger bullying that is going on, out in the world? It seems clear to me, that if kids are being bullied from a very young age, by those that raise them, that it would only make sense to bully others as a way to feel a sense of control over their own environment.
This is one of the inner pages:
"In Britain, psychedelia is totally linked with nostalgia, and it shouldn't be. Psychedelia's about exploration,discovering new colours. It is not about looking back 20 years. That's as irrelevant as cabaret bands playing Elvis covers. Psychedelis's always got to go "further".

The nastiness, if people are so inclined, should be directed at the Mail itself. They know what they are printing, and they know the kind of reaction articles will get from its slightly hysterical readers. And they encouraged it. Well, they have to make money, you may think. But they also have a responsibility to show a duty of care to their employees, even if these people are employed on a freelance basis. They have made a fortune from this article and the attention it has received, rightly or wrongly from the world at large.
Let the dough balls rest in the fridge for one hour. Meanwhile preheat oven 180°C. Line out two baking trays with baking paper. Take the dough balls out of the fridge and put them on the baking tray. Bake the cookies in the lower third of the oven for 10 to 15 minutes (depending on how hard you like them). Cookies will flatten a bit and should be golden. They are still soft when you take them out of the oven. Let them cool completely on a cooling rack.
A nice effect is the walking IV in which the interviewer and guest stroll side-by-side toward the camera. The camera operator walks backwards maintaining a constant distance. Obviously this must be well planned. The camera operator should have someone to act as a guide — the usual routine is for the guide to place their hand in the middle of the operator’s back and walk with them.
We moved in just a week before Megan was due, I brought her home from the hospital to the first house she ever knew. As she grew up, we walked through the town almost every day, crossing and re-crossing the foot-bridge over the railway, from east to west, past the library and the church, between school, shops and home. We picked blackberries in Jubilee Park when the weather was good, pick-and-mix in Woolworths when it was bad.
Ok. Enough of my complaining. Just tell it to me straight. Get over it. Its a dang ankle, stop complaining.
No, there was a school band, then there was one band which never played any gigs, so Sparks were my first proper band.
For clarity – and to dispel the sense that I might be a Luddite imposter here – I’m a daily user of new technologies; the happy owner of blackberry, iPhone and iPad. And I can’t imagine a working life without technological tools developed over the past two decades. For a humanities graduate I spend an astonishingly large portion of my life analysing data mined out of the Oracle database that is the fundamental infrastructure for the business I currently work in.

Love you all!
The truck driver asks him "Why did you do that?!"
Of course there was hate on the interwebz: that people were stupid to put their confidence in someone they'd never met, that her readers were stupid to care so much about something so trivial anyway. So much victim-blaming, with a hint of misogyny: if something's cared about by a group of women, how important can it be? These commenters ignore the larger issue: in the interest of saving a buck, individuals put their trust in someone else, only to be ripped off and violated. That goes beyond a niche interest.
His style is elegant and spare. But the simplicity and directness of his writing should not be taken for a lack of depth. While most crime books are almost wholly plot-driven, Indridason’s novels weave together story lines that echo and refract off one another in an almost poetic way. I think these books will stand the test of time and deserve to be read for their underlying psychological themes as well as for the satisfying resolution of the mystery. Many crime books are only fit to be read and cast aside, but Indridason’s linger in the memory, summoning the reader to return, re-read and re-think.

So what is this book all about? The publisher describes it thus:

Let's put aside the obvious comparisons to Washed Out and Neon Indian. Yes, you can call Casa Del Mirto 'chillwave' or 'glo-fi', but I feel the songs have a different mood, something more intimate, melancholic and familiar. Not to mention those gorgeously brilliant sounds. Casa Del Mirto is the project of Marco Ricci, from Trento. His new album, 1979, is out now on Mashhh! Records.
He is on the road to healing and doing very well. We keep his had protected and re-apply his medication a few times each day. He's such a sweetie pie. :)
Right now, how do you spend your time? A lot of people indulge in working and some waste their day through sleeping. If you belong to the type who wants to sleep a lot, then it is time to put your nothingness into use. Through investing in real estate, a person can spend at least four hours a day investing and making the most of it. There are things that people need to do especially with loved ones, that would be fine. But apart from spending time with families and friends, idle times call for much opportunity in real estate. People who are currently rich are those who seldom spend their time glued to the tube. Giving a parcel of your time to investing will bring about numerous benefits.

TO PREPARE THE PATTIES-
When I assembled the gallery wall around our TV one Saturday, I quickly found out that I had more frames than actual art to put in them. Fortunately, I only needed my computer and printer to remedy that.
Next Steps in Care, in collaboration with SAGE and SAGECAP, recently released a fact sheet that provides practical advice for LGBT caregivers. In addition to a checklist on important legal documents, the guide also explains how hospital discharges happen, and recommends “Do not wait for the social worker on the unit to find you. Instead, find the social worker as soon as you can.” If a caregiver and their loved one lives near a state border or spend a lot of time in two states, the guide also recommends obtaining documents for both states since civil union or domestic partner laws may not carry across state lines.

Do you love cows? Those irresistible cows that come in all shapes and sizes....of which my favorite is the Belted Galloway. Well, if you do, you'd be in good company. My step-daughter loves cows so much that she often says "I Love Cows" randomly. She has cow purses, cow stuffed animals, cow keychains, etc and I wouldn't be surprised if she decorates her future home in a cow motif!
I excused myself and stepped into the backyard to smoke a cigarette and calm my nerves, which were crawling atop one another like beetles. The bird feeders, which my father used to always keep fully stocked, were empty. There were no birds singing or fluttering about. The world was frozen in time. I looked across the yard at the screen shelter my father used to frequent, sort of camping in his own backyard, sometimes for a night, sometimes for a full weekend, sometimes just to steal a moment or two of privacy.
As if the usual mosquito influx isn't enough, we recently removed the fish we had in the turtle tank and this morning I found a ton of mosquitoes breeding in there.

This project I've mentioned before, and it's still ongoing. I am up to the letter "i" now, but I already failed to leave enough space for all my patterns in some of the letters... so I'm going to have to either make *another* book, or go to the other side of the pages. These are done on a moleskine japanese fold-out book. Each letter has anywhere from 1 to 4 pages, with 15 squares on a page. Each square is just under an inch square, except the letter box, which *is* one inch.
Looks lovely, doesn't she?

I've had an amazing time with Tyler and with Emily. I remember thinking many times as did activities together at home or away on an adventure such as the zoo, or hanging out at the mall, or whatever else, "It doesn't get any better than this!" I'm so privileged to have been able to stay home with my two children and raise them in this way. We've done so much together; had so many good times, and I have many treasured memories.

I asked Roach what he thought was up with Johnson. Is he insane; a complete and ruthless opportunist, who puts his finger to the wind and acts accordingly, his previous statements notwithstanding; or is there some third possibility I’d neglected? A third option occurred to me, and I asked Roach if Johnson had fallen in love at some point with a girl whose politics were diametrically opposed to his, and he submitted, in order to stay in her good graces?
I couldn't remember all of them offhand - and I was interested in the long list, too - so I asked if she could remind me. No, of course she couldn't. She had to look them up on the internet.

Another says he was chased by a group of Asian youths who screamed insults and spat at him.
Well, yeah. According to Mike Dooley, the missing ingredient was me. It's all well and good to trust in the Universe to create abundance in our lives, but first we have to make contact, by doing what we can, with what we have, from where we are. We have to engage the magic, start the ball rolling. We have to take a baby step in the direction of our dreams. Then and only then will the Universe move to do its part, and kick in a string of inspiration and synchronicities and right-people-at-the-right-time coinkydinks to keep things flowing along.
They were the days.
There are three main reasons to keep a clean grill. The first is that a clean, well-maintained grill will have a longer useful life than a dirty, sloppy one. Grills can be expensive and it’s often less costly to maintain them than to replace them.

However, the facts clearly demonstrate that, although non-whites make up just over 10% of the population, they account for the vast majority of all victims of gang related murder and almost all the perpetrators, certainly over 90%.
Lauren says, "despite the fact that we've been inspired by song titles all year long, when i sat down to make a specifically "music influenced" card, my mind went totally blank! then i did what i always do when i'm stumped: i went foraging through my stash of vintage stuff. within five minutes i had the sheet music and a plan, within another five i had found the gorgeous victorian postcard on t'internet and printed it out. not long after that, i was done. i love it when a plan comes together!" :)
What the FBI didn’t tell us about the hotel malware threat – Do you use the internet in hotels when travelling abroad? Do you think it’s safe to do so? The FBI thinks you should be careful.. but is being surprisingly coy about the details.
After making the daily commute to the office for over 7 years to my ‘wonderful job’ as a recruitment consultant, I was offered a promotion which came with the added bonus of the chance to work from home.
Bits and pieces have filtered out of that campaign over the years but none is more telling than the testimony that on the day that John Edwards was to announce his intention to run for president, his aide, picking him up from the airport, found the mistress, Rielle Hunter, accompanying the “great man”. In the back seat of the SUV, Edwards and Hunter passed a bottle of champagne back and forth as Elizabeth Edwards awaited her husband at the event. Wow!

This week was boring as shit for the most part since the TV thingy is brokey wokey 4 sum raisins and I'm only able to watch live television on it which is lames because there's mostly only paid programming on late at night. I finished Dead Island on Sunday and since then I haven't been able to think of a new game which I didn't want to buy. I have anime I could be watching but I feel like it'd be too much work to watch anything aside from Iroha or S;G. So basically the only way I can keep myself entertained right now is by either watching anime or by asking autismal as fuck "wat do" questions on farmsperg.
Sighing, Toni hung up and started to walk away. Robbie looked after her and quickly ran to stop her, tapping her on the shoulder.
The other day, mama and my sister, Kristi, came home late from church. There was an after-church luncheon that they had stayed for. Although neither of them ate. Gumbo (yuck!) and… Turtle soup. Turtle soup?! Who in their right mind would kill a poor, harmless little turtle just to make soup?! There should be a special corner of hell reserved for people who kill turtles! As if beef, poultry, pork, fish, and deer aren’t enough!! Now they have to kill turtles!! Oh, and frogs. Let’s not forget those. They’re cute and awesome too!

Students, can consider taking up courses such as hospitality, tourism management, culinary or hotel management. When we choose a course to study, it is important to look for the job opportunities available, because you don’t want to spend RM70,000 and 4 years for a degree to come out and find yourself jobless.
It would appear, yet again, that Megaladon LLP does not feature in the latest Chambers & Partners directory or, indeed, The Legal 500. It is with regret, therefore, that I have to announce that our former Director of Marketing, David ‘The Airbrusher’ Cholmondely-Cameron-Smythe, was escorted from our premises at 4.30 am this morning by Megaladon LLP security operatives. I know that some of you may have found this distressing, working as you were on our new and exciting plans to set up our own outsourcing operation in the East Indies - but in these dark days of the Jackson report, credit-crunch and the ever present threat of over regulation by sundry regulators, needs must. Mr Cholmondely-Cameron-Smythe is an enthusiastic gardener, which is fortunate, because he will now have an opportunity to ‘engage’ with this interest and ‘transition’ from employment to a less stressful lifestyle.
Considered solely for the romance between Thornton and Margaret Hale, you might say it’s a more serious version of Pride and Prejudice insofar as we watch through the heroine’s eyes as she hates him at first sight and reluctantly but completely changes her mind throughout the course of the show. It’s not an easy sell. I’ve seen the series about 12 times and each time Thornton’s early brutality, as well as his strange subsequent self-revelations about his family’s past, make him an oddly moody brute of a man.

In nature we do see a law similar to natural selection. However, even in nature that law does not always reign. Happenstance, compassion, animal instinct, etc, sometimes leads to the weaker one’s triumph in a event. So we should not assume that the law of natural selection is absolute.

I got this kit from Scrapdango. It's mostly Simple Stories but I added my own Bazzil Basics washi tape and the staples. I cut the center of the pp and flipped it over and taped it back in. The small tape pieces are cs stickers from SS, then I cut out the title block and punched the top, inked and stapled it down, added the photos, brackets, stars (after cutting the orange one down a little), added the burlap ribbon, twisted the washi tape and stapled it down. Then finished it off with the word stickers.
Szszsz had a run of games and has made some splendid saves. He has also kept some clean sheets. I feel he needs to improve on his diving to the left hand side of his post. Ipswich’s Priskin and the Brown Haired Louie of Everton scored in that position.
So when I found out I was pregnant in April 2009, my husband and I took a hard look at our budget to see what we needed to do. Would I be able to stay home? Would I need to keep working? Both options were on the table. We figured out that if we saved every extra penny we had, cut out splurges and excessive/unnecessary spending, we could save enough for me to stay at home for one year.
I stared at the screen. What people could I tell that I hadnt already told?

Truly I have felt like crawling in a hole for days and days. I don't want a party, in fact I'm getting my teeth cleaned this week that's how high partying is on my list. I've spent a little time wallowing, reflecting, and wondering if I'm in the right place at this monumental time in my life or not. I'm in a weird place.
To the House at quarter to one, where the new Peruvian ambassador Julio Ernesto Muñoz Deacon came to lunch. We had an excellent discussion covering a lot of ground - Peru's rapid growth; the dependence on extractive industries; the problem of water; Peru's relations with the neighbours and particularly Brazil; the problem of inequality, and President Humala's remarkable standing in the polls.
The way I see things, second person narratives have a strong emphasis on what is there to see. Strong on impression and description to immerse the reader in the world, but not to force them into a certain character mold, the second person POV is very much one that has an empty character ‘shell’ for a reader to insert themselves into, and thus allows one to experience the story as if it is happening directly to the reader. Other than obvious cues (such as getting tired when running, or a scene where you get drunk after drinking three cups of ale etc.), the reader’s experience is very much that of looking in on the world and story that the writer has created.
All because management would not give us just one more reporter – on a fixed term contract of just a year, no less – to help us out with the ridiculous workload that has meant three reporters churning out nine newspapers for our much-abused readers.

Iván Meade - How would you describe your style?
It is the companion cliché to ‘No Safe level” that requires the typical Anti-Smoker drone to stick to the script, and always refer to smoking and smokers in the most derogatory terms possible. Even if they agree with some tiny portion of the smokers’ argument, they are NEVER to verbalize that support. This creates the illusion of unified, universal support for the “denormalization” of smoking and of smokers. The problem is that the “science” cited in defense of their coercion, doesn’t support their claims at all, and they know it.
As you can see, in the past I would not have done this as the red and white striped paper is entirely under the guard I can't hold it in place. Even if I was to hold it from the other side and just put the small edge under that I wanted to be cut I always found it would move. So now attaching a longer piece to the bottom opens up a whole new world.

In response to a vision, they place a wooden cross overlooking the land. The details of where it goes, its dimensions etc. are quite specifically prophetically confirmed.

101. One important key to success is self-confidence. An important key to self-confidence is preparation. – Arthur Ashe
This is a story about spring, baseball and the first wonderful and crazy argument of the new year. Baseball, I think, is the best argument game we have going. Sure, in other sports you can argue Tiger vs. Jack or Sampras vs. Federer or Montana vs. Unitas or whatever. But after a while it kind of fizzles out. You don't really hear people arguing about who was the best pulling guard in NFL history or who was the best on-the-ball defender in the NBA. But I've had an argument going with a friend about whether Cory Snyder or Jesse Barfield had a stronger arm for about 10 years. And every year, right around this time, when the trees start to show a little color, when light starts to last into the early evening, we fight about it again.
As an ex-bullied person, the worst thing you can do is shut yourself away. Staying at home and avoiding people allows your fears to go unchallenged and for your confidence to stay low. How do you know whether people out there are good and friendly if you don’t go out and give them a chance? Even going for a walk on your own can lighten your mood and help you feel more in touch with the outside world. Get in touch with friends, go out for a meal or to the cinema. Interacting with people will build your confidence and take your mind off your worries. It will also give you a more healthy and balanced outlook on the world: it’s not as scary as you might think and there’s a lot of good things to get involved in.

Choose to trust Jesus with everything. Don’t compartmentalize your faith. Instead, decide to trust Jesus with every part of your life – from your relationships to your work. In prayer, give Jesus all of your needs, desires, fears, hopes, and dreams, trusting Him to handle your concerns and work to give you what’s best. This will free you from the pressure of trying to make things work out yourself in the ways you want and the frustration of hitting the limits of your own power to control your life.

Naturally, the government will argue that, by taking such powers, it is protecting our freedoms in the ‘war against terror’. As I understand it, the ‘war against terror’ is designed to protect our freedoms from those who oppose them, primarily ‘Al Qaeda’, which may or may not exist as the government portrays it. It is not the first time this country has made a collective stand against something which threatens our freedoms, but the governments approach is novel, to say the least. In order to protect those freedoms, it is steadily eroding them: this would have been akin to fighting communism in the Cold War by becoming a Soviet Republic, or fighting Fascism by becoming fascist.

Renfield (Dwight Frye) is an English attorney travelling to Transylvania to finalize the sale of Carfax Abbey in London to the mysterious Count Dracula (Lugosi). The next evening, Renfield is on a boat bound back to London. When the boat arrives, the entire crew is dead and Renfield is a maniacally laughing lunatic. He is committed to the sanitarium of Dr. Seward (Herbert Bunston), which is adjacent to Carfax Abbey. Dracula introduces himself to Seward, Seward’s daughter Mina (Helen Chandler), Mina’s fiancé John (David Manners), and Mina’s friend Lucy (Frances Dade). Lucy becomes quite taken the exotic Count. Then she winds up dead, drained of blood. Now Mina seems to be inexplicably drawn to the Count… Only Professor Abraham Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan) seems to know that Dracula is a vampire, and responsible for Lucy’s death. Now John and Dr. Seward need his help to keep Mina from suffering the same fate.

This small though not barren spot, Iona, Hy, or Columbkill, only two miles in length and one mile in breadth, has been distinguished – 1. By the monastery of St. Columba, founded A.D. 566, whose abbot exercised an extraordinary jurisdiction over the bishops of Caledonia- 2. By a classic library, which afforded some hopes of an entire Livy; and, 3. By the tombs of sixty kings, Scots, Irish, and Norwegians, who reposed in holy ground. See Usher (p.311, 360-370) and Buchanan (Rer. Scot. 1. ii. p. 15, edit. Ruddiman).

So, if I’m going to name a child after a character in a fantasy novel, Shakespeare seemed like the safest way to go. There won’t be any horrifying moment of discovery when my child realizes, “What? You named me after the hero in a pulp fiction sword and sorcery novel with tacky cover art?” * Miranda is literate and intellectual and only secretly geeky if you want it to be. And it’s beautiful, unusual, and may be shortened to a nickname without unfortunate effect.

In the novel, it happens. Suddenly. And people die. Those who don't are struggling to survive. As I said, it's a gripping story. Do I recommend it? Oh, yeah! Because it's happening. Yesterday's news report says a huge ice sheet, three times the area of Manhattan, has broken from a Greenland glacier.
In 1959, Hartmann became co-editor of the Schott magazine Neue Zeitschrift für Musik, in spite of his numerous obligations and commissions. The world premier of his last completed commission, the 8. Symphonie, took place 1963 in Cologne. It excels not only in the comparative shortness and reduction of statement, but also in a delight for sound experiments, which was until then unprecedented in Hartmann’s works. The two movements of this work, Cantilène and Dithyrambe Scherzo-Fuga, are merged with a seamless transition and have the same thematic material. Despite their contrasting character, both movements show a preference for imitation and the principle of continuous variation. The last movement with elements from scherzo, fugue and finale, based on the same material, gives the impression of a merging synopsis of all of Hartmann’s symphonic works. After the completion of the 8. Symphony, Hartmann turned towards the opera again, after having rejected numerous attempts. In 1960-61, he contributed the middle movement Ghetto to the cycle Jüdische Chronik, a joint work with Henze, Blacher, Dessau and Wagner-Régency. It was a threnody to the last hours of the Warsaw ghetto.

Now, I didn’t eat good today. The only think that I ate today was my left over Apple Bee’s Blackened Chicken Penne (1/2 order 655 calories), 1/2 of bread (140 calories), and 2 Mozzarella sticks (207 calories). My total calories today was 1002 calories today. I guess it’s a good thing I haven’t eaten anything today. But I swear Adipex really has been suppressing my appetite. But I don’t think I will be 15 lbs lighter when I weigh in this week. I’m going to cry if I’m not, but clearly it’s my fault. I haven’t been eating like I should have and I’ve been letting a lot of stress get to me lately too. And I clearly know that’s not healthy. I only drank about 3 bottles of water. But I know that I will get back on my 8 bottles of water of day. I’m almost fully stock. I want to go back and get one more case since I have the $3 off coupon. I could get some Marsh water since it’s $2.99 but pay $.99 for a 24 pack of Dasani isn’t bad at all.

Looking closely at the typography of both the original cover and the “title” of the Errata Edition furthers my feelings of space-time disruption. Adding to the weirdness is the slight-but-noticeable rise and fall in the hand-set letters of THE MUSUEM OF MODERN ART on the original’s cover, versus the flawless, digitally set straightness of the title lying just below.
I can find no current info. online about the situation, but this is probably another building that will be lost to time, to circumstance, and from what I've read, perhaps a little bit of greed on the part of the property owner. He would rather tear the barn down than to simply give it to the town.

They could only watch and hope that somehow this was all going to end well. I wish I could tell them what I know of these familiar, far away events.

Tea leaves typically go through a series of steps before they are ready to be sold in shops. Leaves are wilted, either under sun or a temperature controlled oven. Then, they are bruised slightly to enable exposure to air and thus, oxidation. After the level of oxidation desired is reached, the leaves go through a process of fixation to stop oxidation. Lastly, it is dried and packed. While this is typical, many teas go through special intermediate processes that give a particular tea its unique characteristics and they vary from tea to tea.

Guess what? I did a shitty job welding two intake manifolds. I had built a test manifold before this one, to get all my angles and dimensions correct. So I grabbed it out of the bin, and bolted everything back up. Salty fired on the first kick, and ran great for about 2 minutes, holding a perfect idle and taking throttle. Then I heard it stumble and saw a puff from the same exact location! What the hell. I think I'm just cracking what little weld is there as I tighten the nuts to secure it to the head. Two manifolds down. But at least I maybe found my mystery problem?
Farms contribute more in taxes than they require in services, whereas suburban development costs more than it generates in taxes, according to several studies. On average, for every $1 in revenue raised by residential development, governments must spend $1.17 on services, thus requiring higher taxes of all taxpayers. For each dollar of revenue raised by farm, forest, or open space, governments spend 34 cents on services.
On the bright side, for having only two tables, I did leave the restaurant with $85, some chocolate, and a hand-blown glass sea turtle ornament. One of the guys at my party was showing his co-worker a gorgeous glass sea turtle ornament he had made. I commented on how pretty it was, how impressed I was that he had made it, and that I sort of had a "thing" for turtles. At the end of their meal, our maitre^d came up to me and said "Merry Christmas." The guy gave me the ornament! Luckily, he was still there, so I was able to thank him profusely, and he told me about the gallery he represents. The group also left me a little wrapped chocolate because "I probably don't get 'treated' very often."

Then there are the corners – where the skaters build momentum for the coming straightaway – and the cement ledges are jam-packed with rowdy and excited fans. They keep the excitement going in the building, starting waves and cheers and belting out “Sweet Caroline” or “Head and Shoulders, Knees and Toes” (hand movements and all) at the tops of their lungs, almost loud enough to drown out the accompanying oompah band. Those fans aren’t there just to watch a skating meet, or to cheer on their favorites, or see who will win; they’re there to have FUN.
I’m currently living in Davis. The house is surrounded by nature, while to the city it’s a bike ride of merely three minutes. And the best part: Around this place there are a bunch of orange and grapefruit trees. Recently, while I was waiting for someone, I collected two of these grapefruits and put them on this orange-colored chair. I don’t know what made me do that. It was most likely a mixture of boredom and curiosity about how this combination of colors would look on a picture. So here my first-ever arranged pictures.

When a booking problem led us to spend a couple of nights in a more remote place, we looked through the gazillion take-out menus in the kitchen only to find that the few vegetarian options that existed were all deep-fried and unhealthy. Then we found a menu for a place called Mellow Mushroom and their food seemed somewhat healthier (sprouts were involved). However, as I read through the menu, the only sandwich that seemed a good option was the “Portobello and Cheese Hoagie - a grilled Portobello mushroom cap big enough to fit on your head basted by garlic butter accompanied by artichoke hearts, sun-dried tomatoes, spinach, and Feta. Garnished with sprouts.”

Anyway, I’d seen a lot of porn in my day already, so I just mimicked what I’d seen there.

Gary Allen’s Nothing On But the Radio serenaded us from the radio as we had sex.

The first time I had sex lasted seven minutes. Go me!
Third is "Down to Earth!", this issue's Vampirella story, by Mike Royer (art) and Forrest Ackerman (story). This story is notable for being the only instance where an issue had a Vampirella story but it did not lead off the issue. The story also features Vampirella's twin sister Draculina, in her sole appearance, who acts as host. This story features Vampirella trying out for a Monsterella contest at the Warren offices where she is selected the winner by James Warren and Forrest Ackerman, giving her the name Bambi Aurora. Traveling on a plane to Hollywood, a bolt of lightning strikes it, blowing it up. An absolutely horrific story with a ridiculous ending, this is probably the worst Vampirella story of all time. Thankfully this would be the last time Royer or Ackerman did a Vampirella story and she wouldn't start in a story again until issue 8.
Not sure if I've told you all, but I've actually gone down in weight and inches since finding out I was moving- I guess that's what being busy does to ya!

All of the (many, many, many) flowers from the funeral had been brought into the room and two women were busy in a corner stripping all the petals and placing them into a basket near the head of the casket. As the main woman sang that unearthly song, everyone in the room stood up and began to file past the body in a circle, picking up a handful of petals out of the basket each time they passed and sprinkling them over him as they whispered their final good-byes.

We did tours and walked everywhere so exercise was not an issue. My friend was wearing a pedometer. In all we walked 20 miles while we were gone. Not bad at all. The food was amazing as I knew it would be. With all of the great food and gelato every night while in Rome I knew I had gained. I jumped on the scale this morning and weighed 181.4 which is a loss of almost 2 pounds from my weight of 183 when I left. I was shocked and over joyed! I want to thank everyone for their kind and encouraging words on my last posts. As always you guys are awesome!

From reading and listening to high quality material, Plantinga concludes, the preacher, and the writer, I might add, can absorb “excellent language, even if unconsciously. He’s like an articulate child from a family of articulate speakers.” May we train our minds and ears, and our students’, so we can write like that.

In the end, I think that While He Was Away accomplished exactly what it set out to do: tell a real-life story of love and war and the people who are most deeply affected by both. And something about this book definitely affected me personally, because it was raw and real, and it didn't try too hard to make an impression or be overly-dramatic. Honestly, it didn't have to-- the story was just that good, and the characters were just that relatable. I would recommend this book to all my readers, because it was realistic, genuine and heartfelt with a wonderful message that can't help but encourage and inspire you. And really, that's about everything I could ask for in a book!

I came across this design on Pinterest last week, and when clicking over to see the resource I was taken to Houzz, where someone suggested this lamp might have been made from a 1940's vase. What a fantastic idea, if you can't find just the right lamp, how about looking for a vase and put your DIY skills to work! (Or find a great lamp shop to work with like Naomi's here in Portland.)
Highlight up to three of your top priority goals you would like to achieve in the next 1 year, then do the same for the next 3-5 years and then the next 10 years. So you should have about 9 goals to achieve in the next decade with enough clarity to paint a good picture of life on your terms. Even if you don’t think or know how you will achieve them, highlight them anyway.

The section on illnesses and first aid reminds one how risky travel could be without modern antibiotics and other medical procedures. Snake bites, rabid dogs, cholera and dysentery are all mentioned. Young children were particularly vulnerable, and they advise vaccination whenever possible, and careful supervision of ayahs (nursemaids). The recipes are mostly English, or adaptations of English food, rather than Indian, although chutneys and curried vegetables do appear.

The movie actually has a lot more to do with "this current age" than it does with anything that happened in the Fifth Century. Prothero has certainly bought the message of its fable. It's another manifestation of the old "Conflict Thesis" that seems to be reinforced by the actual, very modern, conflict between reactionary fundamentalist Biblical literalists and modern science. For Prothero, as for many people without a good grasp of the history of science, if (some) religious types are opposed to proper science today then it makes sense that they must have always done so. Therefore he likes the fact that this is being reinforced by Amenábar's movie and is oblivious to the fact that Amenábar has had to distort history to get it to conform to the "Conflict" model.

7. Citrus and citrus juice – I use lemons in a lot of cooking as well, especially for vegetables. I think the juice and zest gives everything just enough sour and a good bite in chicken dishes, and can even be made nice and sweet if used with sugar like lemon meringue pie, so it’s pretty versatile too. Same with the oranges. Orange juice always in my house.

The American culture wars began earlier, back in the 1960s, with young liberals angry at the suffering in Vietnam and the injustice still experienced by African-Americans. But when some of them adopted a style that was anti-American, anti-authority and anti-puritanical, conservatives saw their most sacred values desecrated and they counter-attacked.
But it’s not so difficult to get out and honour yourself and your Gods by quiet actions in the world. An allotment or orchard project to bring pleasure to others and food to your family. Litter-picking as you take the dog for a walk, or the kids to school. Even volunteering to help your local space, be it Neighbourhood Watch, local environmental groups or charity work. Consider how best to connect your faith to your life, and do it. Take responsibility, rise to a self-imposed challenge. Be adventurous, explore – find your own quest!

And here are two more minor reasons why I created a blog. One is that we created a charity and we wanted it to be introduced to the world. It’s called The Healthy Kidchen. The Healthy Kidchen is a charity that feeds kids. My family started in a public school. And until now, we kept feeding a class of 50-Grade 2 students. The other reason is that I wanted to inspire kids to bake.

Nowadays, I look back on my efforts with more than a little embarrassment -- the follies of youth! One of several that this issue of Dragon brings to memory.

Of nothing may this be more true than of books. CS Lewis once said that a story worth reading at the age of 10 will also be worth rereading at the age of 50. In that later venture, it is our prior selves, as well as the text, that we reread. And what we find is how deeply, at all stages, it has been reading us.

In May 1929 Georgia O'Keeffe visited New Mexico for the first time, and was immediately taken in hand by Mabel Dodge, who lent her a studio and a base from which to explore the surrounding country. O'Keeffe was already famous, both for her flower paintings and as a doyenne of the New York art scene; her husband Alfred Stieglitz was a mover and a shaker who helped her become one of the most prominent and highly-paid artists of her time.

Yet more importantly, I want to give, not only myself, but my family the gift of a life that is active and healthy.

Dear My Dream Publisher Of Good Humor,
Jesus knew his spiritual journey depended upon responsiveness to God’s invitations. Although his job was the most crucial in human history, Jesus did not get compulsive, preoccupied or unable to practice the presence of God or people. In the midst of interruptions and overwhelming need, Jesus learned how to discern between invitations. – Pg. 18

First off, most of the fruits and veggies I want to grow need warmth. The house is kept in the mid-60′s range, so a lot of container plants wouldn’t thrive if left randomly hanging about. And sunlight is inconsistent for growing indoors, especially if windows are partially blocked by trees or don’t face south.

Tragically, like young gays and lesbians of previous years, today’s transgender children may fall victim to a mental health professional’s insistence that such behavior is abnormal or transitional. Some professionals may also claim that a transgender behavior can be cured or reprogrammed. There are documented cases of children and adults being subjected to noxious methods including: shock therapy, confinement, institutionalization, violence, verbal abuse, etc. No matter how well-intended these activities amount to nothing more than human rights’ abuse. No adult or child should be subject to such abuse in effort to make him or her conform to social stereotypes, particularly when varying gender identities are part of the human experience.

189 Spring Street
As Johnny walks through the caged wire door to make his entrance onto ‘The Street’, the shadows create similar bar patterns that not only suggest a jail-like institutional tone, but are reminiscent of Cathy’s birdcage and the world of ‘backstage’ (again, through contrast, implying that The Street is a performance space). Johnny rolls his neck as he enters the stage, an actor preparing for performance. The structure of what plays out on ‘The Street’ is governed by three clear and distinct sections (Johnny’s interviews with each of the three witnesses to Sloan’s murder). While ample attention has been given to ideological readings of these politically loaded segments in regards to racial and Cold War tensions, it is in this case perhaps more fruitful to approach them as a point of comparison with a seemingly irrelevant Hollywood musical, On The Town (1949). Both Shock Corridor and On The Town are divided into three main narrative threads: the numbers that introduce the romantic storylines in On The Town are Ann Miller’s “Prehistoric Man” routine (she outright demands for a pre-theory primal man, with “no psychoanalysis”), Betty Garrett’s “Come Back to My Place” number (Frank Sinatra sings his desire to visit New York landmarks of a time past while she aggressively invites sexual contact instead, repeating “come back to my place” in reply to his various requests for cab destinations) and the “Miss Turnstyles” ballet (Vera-Ellen and Gene Kelley tells the story of Miss Turnstyles journey from small town USA to New York, laced with a nostalgia for a past America). All three numbers are predicated about an attempt to reclaim a semblance of lost past.

This is particularly satisfying because it's been a long road to get to the level of competency I now have. I have been doing what is now my main job for roughly three and a half years. There are three main books of business that my division deals with and Book A is one I've always been well acquainted with as I worked in that unit for about three years. But Books B and C I've never worked in and I was never trained in them. But I've finally gotten the level of knowledge necessary to talk about it with interested candidates so that I can say what we are asking them in terms of review work. I also have enough experience, finally, to be able to speak with potential reviewers and not be nervous. These are all physicians, some of them arrogant and self important, a few who are unabashed about telling me they make $1,000 in fifteen minutes (that happened, an anesthesiologist who I inadvertently made feel guilty for saying such a thing). So it is gratifying to know that I am, actually a professional in my field.
I had forgotten that home is not always comfortable. The church will always be my home, whether comfortable or not. When my grandparents died, it was still home. When we were burgled, three times, it was still home. When my parents invite over all sorts of strangers who make me feel a little unsettled, it is still home.
A big part of an unschooling parent's job is finding ways for our kids to learn what they want to learn. It's just something we do. In our case, we're in an urban area with lots of resources, so it's not even that hard.

Better to label these actors “Manipulators” than “Conspirators”. Whether the sparks were created, facilitated, or simply exploited is besides the point.

These are the types of sketches you need to be practicing when you are doodling, these basic drawing techniques. Think of a action like holding a phone and try and draw it on your note pad. Think how you might draw a gesture such as waving, or pointing, action arrows help a lot in capturing motion. Study how others draw storyboards. I find that thinking about people as Lego figures helps, I always find that these simple characters can capture a whole host of interactions just by playing with poses and making a small additions to what they hold and how their faces look. People don’t get represented much simpler than this, plus if you use the real Lego’s you can practice drawing what you see.
I told my friend last night that I was going to write a book called Pregnancy: The Shit No One Tells You That Could Happen. I’m convinced no one tells you as then no one would want to get pregnant! But seriously, I feel like I could collaborate with other moms like the All Knowing Julie and we could write both an informative and humorous book about the random crap that can happen when you’re pregnant – more than just morning sickness and weight gain. Maybe it could help others stop with Dr. Google, too.

After Mass one mother told me I had to keep working on her sons – she clearly wants a Priest in the family: great! But it must be hard for a parent to hold an ideal which runs so contrary to what society expects. The world wants us to marry, to be successful, to earn money, to have our own house, to have independence. Christ wants more: he wants everything we have, everything we are, set apart. Set apart for what? The plebs sancta Dei, the Holy People of God, whom he calls his priests to serve without limits, searching out the lost and gathering all into the safety of sheepfold.

Sometimes I may see a peculiar/horrible/worthy of criticism programme/advertisement on television and come up with an idea for a video of my own, or a sketch. Unless a programme/ad is especially popular or notorious, it's fairly unlikely that I would be able to find it on youtube or torrent it (gasp), and literally impossible anyway since my internet connection seems to take a ring road through The Treacle Dimension before it gets to my computer. This technology allows me to rip whatever I need from my Sky+ recording and do what I like.
His essay Containing Chaos (unfortunately no longer freely visible in it's entirety) begins:We are now engaged in a conflict that will dictate whether we succeed or fail in the 21st century. Our adversary in this conflict is, in short, the threat posed by globalization.and concludes (my emphasis):Disruptions that result in societal and economic chaos occur most readily in societies where the health and vigor of a society has decayed. In other words, the social and economic system that the nation-state administers must be seen as fair and just, and it must deliver tangible results to the greatest number of people possible. Anything less than this and societal breakdown becomes extremely likely should disruption occur, since the allure of participation in oppositional groups, from black-market crime to guerrilla/terrorist groups, will outweigh outcomes available through participation in the status quo. In short, the nation-state will lose its legitimacy with large subsets of its population.

Stage Two: Shame and Doubt. You’re in dance class. Your teacher asks you to demonstrate a new move or step. You want to… but this is more than insecurity, is this a panic attack? You may experience the feeling of astro-projecting out of your body and your confidence is trapped in a box. You can’t see your body moving right, even if it is. You start to wonder why you are in the class at all. A welling feeling is starting in your stomach and starting to ooze into your face. Irrational thoughts have taken over. You may wish to start screaming and crying. Please don’t. Save your sobs for a more appropriate time and place.

The image here is one of Pettibone’s Flowers of 1971. Gallerie Sho from Tokyo had on view three of these little beauties as well as two small Marilyns, 1978. Look at the dimensions, the Flowers are less than 2 inches square. Each painting is carefully screen printed, stretched on canvas and framed with wee nails and slates of wood. These miniscule works are reduced to sheer perfection. Oddly, seeing theses tiny Warhols touched me much more than seeing originals. Of course without the original, full-size pieces, Pettibone’s couldn’t exist. And yet seeing these Lilliputian paintings is breathtaking. They become objects, trinkets, toys.
That being said, I do want a few things for my family and myself in 2012. I just want us to spend more time together. More meaningful time might be the better way to say it. We are in the same room kind of together a lot. I hope we can experience some fun things in life together. The other thing I want is to spend more time outside and less time locked in the house. I received a copy of Let's Go Outside by Jennifer Ward for Christmas and cannot wait to put it to good use. On the same note I want to make things together; bake with my kids, do crafts that involve more than crayons and paper (no really), let them create. Lastly, I just want to spend time with friends and family; deepen the relationships we have. I'm sure there are a few other things floating around, but I do NOT want to make a list and this teetering on the line. I am excited that this year I will not be pregnant nor will I have a newborn. I have either been pregnant or nursing since August 2006. While I'm not done nursing, feeding an almost one year old is way different than a newborn. Except my almost one year old (I need to stop saying this, it can't be true) still nurses at least six times a day. Anyways, I don't know if we are done having kids forever, but we are for now.
American Life League
Ghostbusters II
One of the group’s long-term members is Tom, who has been with the group for almost four years. “I was in a bad way early in 2008. I had closed down and was struggling to cope with life and my physchiatrist sent me to The Charleston Centre in Paisley for an eight week Assertiveness Management Course. On the very last session Dr Jane Bentley came along as a treat with her bags of djembe drums and held a thirty minute workshop. Something just clicked and for the first time in ages I felt my troubles ebb away. The very next day I plucked up the courage to go to Buddy Beat’s regular weekly meeting, and I have been there ever since.”
Be respectful of and nice to your kids. Hold them close with your words and deeds; show them the love they need and deserve. Don't send them to the corner of your life, physically or emotionally.
My teenager called me crying from school the other day. Aside from the fact she hadn't slept well the night before, she was heartbroken, and for good reason. Once again her father (my ex) turned his back, and gave her the cold shoulder. I watch my daughter suffer and cry, and my heart goes out, but I also get angry. She is genuinely confused and hurt, and there's no amount of words that will fix it. In my head I'm getting in my car, driving 2 hours and kicking some ass. I'm looking for blood. Sigh. I guess I'll behave.
It’s a cycle.

Mae and Pap had a trailer, that in my "child's mind" seems forever away from our home... but when I look at the lot that held our home and their trailer today, I wonder how they both fit! Both their home, and Mamaw's were surrounded by flowers of all kinds: roses, tulips, daffodils and iris to name a few. To this day, an Iris remains my favorite flower... especially a purple bearded iris, there were tons of those in the flower beds. Mae and Mamaw spent a ton of time in those beds caring for them. I have such vivid memories of those beds!
(Myah, that last line just made me burst out laughing.)
These circumstances and the fact that I do not appear, at all, on either of my parents’ 호적 (ho-juk, family register) gave the immigration officer a bit of a headache. He didn’t really know what to do and said he’d never had that situation before. He also said, if I had applied for the F-4 in Korea I would have been denied. This, above all else, confuses the crap out of me. Forgetting all of the particulars of who was what when I was born… if it were the case that I am ineligible for an F-4, why did the NY Consulate issue it to me? Someone has their requirements all messed up… you’d think for something like this it would be consistent, or at least they would only allow one of the institutions to issue the visa to prevent such mishaps. I’m also slightly inclined to believe that everything is actually okay and the NYC consulate knows what its doing and that my situation wasn’t fully explained to the immigration agent, but that doesn’t have anything to do with consulates or immigration offices.

One often disturbing aspect of the film is how often the racist ideology, spoken adamantly by Derek, Daniel, et al, is not always counterbalanced. In the very first scene, Derek offers an a strong speech about how much illegal immigrants are costing the state of California. Then he complains about immigrants taking jobs away from whites before leading an assault on a grovery store owned and operated by minorities. You can almost hear people agreeing with his sentiments before the brutalization of his violent act tears it all down. But that is a rare moment. In many other instances, racist demagoguery goes unanswered outside of the implausibly fast changing of Derek’s mind, which I do not feel is enough to carry the film.
Add to this that home educators have neither been informed or consulted about this and you know this doesn’t bode well for the future. Sneaky is as sneaky does. Beware the frog boiling...
LDV: What is the most challenging aspect?
effects in some neighborhoods—those that received more than a few relocated households—that suggest that crime would have been lower in those neighborhoods had there been no public housing transformation. I live across the street from some of the largest and oldest public housing in New York, a city which didn't follow other metropoli in razing its projects. It seems right now that the city is content to bulldoze and demolish the storefronts and services these residents rely upon, and build condos for people like me in their place.
Furthermore, the bill makes it clear that illegal immigrants will not have access to taxpayer benefits such as food stamps and health care through MO HealthNet. With the passage of this legislation, Missouri sent a clear message that illegal immigrants are not welcome in our state, and that they are certainly not welcome to receive public benefits at the cost of Missouri taxpayers.
Additionally, you'll find if you look deeply, the topics I'm researching. Most of them are just fine but what about the links and information I'm putting in my next book? I've worked hard for what is in my head, do I want you to be able to see everything there before it is published in my next book? Would it put me in breach of my publishing contract? I'm not totally sure (but then again, I'm not totally unsure either it is enough of a question to bother me, however.)

It’s true, my friends. The sun rises once the nighttime shroud has had its moment. The mountain is only accessible by starting at the bottom. There is no apprehension of resurrection until we die, get planted in the dark, quiet ground, and wait a while.
The Old Brown Jug host LA trio Mini Mansions, featuring Michael Shuman from Queens Of The Stone Age. The last minute gig has been put into place as the boys have a night off from their massive UK tour supporting Foster The People. The jaunt which includes stops at Manchester Academy and three nights at Brixton Academy in London has completely sold out, but the band have chosen the Jug as the place to showcase their own one off set. Local support for the how will be in the form of Fetch The Witches. Doors open on 8pm, and admission is £3 on the door.
One of the things I really enjoyed about visiting Japanese Buddhist temples was offering incense in the large outdoor burners that were always available for that purpose.

This cover is just so sweet and romantic! And especially knowing what this book is about, I mean it's just like, bring on the water-works! I love the picture of Penna and David together, they just look so sweet and innocent, and the pinky-peach sunset glow behind them makes the entire scene look very ideal and romantic. It's like a moment captured in time that you can always look back on. Definitely a fan of this cover!

In MAS, there are lots of incompetent deadwoods taken in from the days of Idris Jala. There are lots of managers only managing 2 to 3 people. Some of these managers have attitude and no heart of human that none wants to be under them.
But. I did not find myself caring about Max, or the people in the village. I felt overwhelmed with all the character development of the individual members of the village and wondered if I would be required to learn this all over again in a second book. The main feeling I had was “get on with it”. It seemed slow, even for a cozy. I also wondered if Max would have been able to solve the case if it had not been for the last-minute witness turning up. The conclusion was not worthy of the writing.

Leaders answer the questions – “Who loves/accepts me?” and “Who is in charge?” To have the first and not the latter leads to confusion and throws water on the flames burning in this newly tasked individual. The best time to stoke the flames of excitement is AT THE BEGINNING – letting the fire cool BEFORE parameters are put in place and feedback routine(s) are established does no good.

In 2007, this writer won a prize in the short story section, and we travelled down, my husband and I, all the way from Sussex. At the prizegiving lunch I met writers who had come from the west coast of the USA to collect a £50 prize – such is the respect for this award, and an indication of how much it matters to those whose work is selected. 2011 was no different. Several writers had traveled great distances for their moment of glory – a walk amid warm applause up to the Bridport Arts Centre stage, to collect a cream envelope from this year’s judges... see above - said poet laureate and said lauded writer/performer.
It is possible that still to this day I would not have seen Ninotchka had it not been for its appearance on one of those lists of the best movies ever made or movies you have to see. I bought it as part of a Greta Garbo box set some time before that list crossed my path, a box set that seven years later still has several untouched DVDs. But I am lucky/glad the circumstances led me where they did because Ninotchka truly is one of the best pictures ever made.

Roll up your sleeves because you're going to be busy! All Capricorns are suddenly seized by a desire to become as efficient, effective and productive in everything they do as much as possible. (Stay with this and work with it!) Since you're gung ho to get better organized, at least, give yourself the best tools and support material possible so you can do a great job. (You know what a perfectionist you are.) Get file folders, cleaning equipment, paint, shelving, or whatever you need. You might even get somebody to help you? By the same token, why not apply this zealous energy to improving your health? You are a long-lived sign. You might as well take care of yourself because you'll love yourself for this later. Muuuch later.
For most of these past 29 years I have records of what I budgeted, what I spent, the budget-vs.-actual numbers and anything I was able to save (and not). When I bought my home 20 yrs. and 1 month ago, I knew, going into the closing, almost to the penney, what my payment would be and how I was going to keep this homeownership thing afloat. I prove out my checkbook every month...to the penny...and I don't give up until it balances. I could never imagine being off by a few cents....oh, the humanity! Yes, some of my friends think I'm nuts.

CIC observed that the appellant sought information which was, admittedly, the intellectual property of AIIMS. Section 8(1)(d) of the RTI Act was attracted only when disclosure of information harmed the competitive position of a third party and not of AIIMS itself. Even if AIIMS was treated as a third party, it was not a commercial organisation that competed with other organisations. Further, it was not proved that the experts who prepared the question papers were in a competitive business such that disclosure of these question papers along with their keys could harm their competitive position. In view of the same, the Respondents' contention that the information sought was exempt under Section 8(1)(d) of the RTI Act was rejected. Further, Section 57 of the Copyright Act, 1957 was held to be impertinent as the fact situation did not satisfy the requisite statutory

I couldn’t think of a better candidate for the Editor-in-Chief of the Niner Times. She loves that place more than anyone will understand. I have so much faith in her it’s unbelievable.

There are so many times that I try too hard to fit a role that is just not right for me, be it the athlete, the size zero, or the perfectionist. Yet, when it comes right down to it, the only thing truly worthwhile is love, whether it is the people I love or the activities that I love. And in giving love, I receive love. I can’t– and I won’t– bottle up my soul. Clearly, as my rambling may suggest, this song was a perfect match for me.

‘By this time I had little hope of anything changing but, two days later, as I lay in the bath before my 38 week hospital appointment, my stomach heaved with astonishing vigour as the baby conducted what was evidently a major manœuvre. I didn’t dare to believe that it had turned a full somersault but, to my delight and the total amazement of the consultant and all in attendance, an ultrasound scan later that morning revealed the baby settled in the normal position for birth.’
But what about students who literally cannot afford not to work? I know this is controversial, especially as I’m not in that position, but I really think if you are dedicated and dare I say, desperate enough, you will make it possible. In the summer I hope to get a full time internship, but I’ll still be working weekends, so I’ll be commuting to London 7 days a week. Yes, ridiculously exhausting, and over £200 in travel, but I want it that bad. I’ve also been saving from working so that if I do have to work unpaid I can support myself. I think that the majority of people who say they can’t afford it either haven’t planned in advance for the possibility of working unpaid, or they’re looking for an excuse. I know this isn’t always the case, and I do think that internships should not be allowed to be unpaid over 1 month, as it would be pretty much impossibly for anyone to support themselves for 3 months to a year unpaid, let alone a student. This is why I think we shouldn’t campaign against ALL unpaid internships, but only long term (over 1 month), expenses only internships. They favour those from affluent backgrounds, and create even more elitism than is already present in the fashion industry.
My mother was a nurse. She was trained at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary in the 1930s, something she was immensely proud of, and ran a clinic in Nigeria for a spell before the outbreak of the Second World War. Both her training and her hands-on practice predated the general introduction of penicillin into the germbuster arsenal of local GPs. Although Alexander Fleming discovered the use of penicillin in killing bacteria back in 1928, it wasn't until the end of the War that it came into general use, heralding a post-1945 period described as 'the era of antibiotics.'
The merits of hotness over pretty is easy enough to understand, they made an entire musical about it. Who can forget how pretty Olivia Newton John was at the beginning of Grease. Beautiful and innocent. But her desire to be desired leads her to throw away all that is valuable in herself in the vain hopes of getting the attention of a boy. In the process, she destroys her innocence and thus destroys the pretty. What we are left with is hotness.

After spending an hour or more in The Mercantile, I stepped back outside, and took around Pendleton Square. Up the hill from where I parked, there’s an older building of which I’ve always loved the style, but it rarely has anything in it, store-wise, so I’ve never been inside. It’s now advertising for a salon, and I’m not sure what else. I think it’s because of it’s out-of-the-way position, off the Square, that anything that moves in there doesn’t get much attention.

We should remember that the Father of Jesus is the Elohim Hashem Yah, The Only One God and there is no other God of gods, only the ever existing Jehovah created. Jehovah was the “Yah” (“Ja”) or the “Yes ” (“Ja”), the Being; without Him no life was or is possible. Yahweh and His Spirit, His Thinking are one and the same not separate. The one placed by the Spirit in the womb of the virgin Mary is the “Yah shua” the Jeshua who was given this set apart spirit and was guided by “Yah”, the being of and from God. In all his ways Jesus took the guidance of God His Spirit in him up and was completely observant to Him. We also should try to listen to this Holy Spirit and follow His guidance.

I am blessed!! I never realized how rich my life is. At 54, I’m fairly healthy, I have many, many friends, two wonderful sons, family, and I am on the other side of the world. During these past few months, I have heard from so many people who are following my journey! Many friends and new followers are taking this voyage with me and so while there are days when I feel very alone, I know I can always log on to the Internet and find friends who are with me in spirit! For that, I am so thankful – I recognize now how my words touch others and how their words touch me!
Ultimately, though, I pick names because I like the way they sound--and because, in my mind, they fit the character. By that I don't mean that they fit the character profile, or the character's thematic role. I mean that in in my mind's eye, if I call the character by that name, they answer.

2. To step off noisy Gaushala (the name means "Cow shelter") and enter the gates of Dwarika's heritage hotel is to truly experience another city within the city. Dwarika Das Shrestha devoted his life to collecting the intricate hand-carved wooden pieces being discarded by Kathmandu's modern property developers, not knowing what he'd ever do with them, but sensing their innate value. His hobby eventually became this hotel, which doubles as a museum for Newar art heritage. The complex manages to be enormous and intimate simultaneously, and each room feels individually appointed and hand-crafted.

What a week I’m hungry and I’m beat. Which brings me to this week’s short tale, Goldilocks and The Three Bears? I often wonder how Goldilocks felt that day she was out in the forest and was brave enough to stumble upon a home not having any idea who lived there. We do know the door was unlocked and there were a number of beds, when I think back to the story Goldy tried every bowl of porridge to see which one would suit her taste, after trying each chair to see which one was just the right for her to sit in. It’s take a level of courage and persistence to try new things not knowing what the outcome could be.

We have some farmers in our town and congregation who understand the practices necessary for fruitful produce. A few that I remember from school are that you need to rotate crops between fields, you need to leave fields unplanted every now and then, and you should not cram as many plants as you can in the space available. If you don’t rotate crops and leave fields unplanted you may seem more productive in the short term, but eventually you will drain the land of it’s natural fertility and make it unusable until it has time to rest and recover. In the same way, if you plant as many plants as you can fit in the space available it may seem like you will have more produce, but the plants will not grow well and the fruit they produce will be far from ideal. In other words, if you don’t follow responsible agricultural techniques, you will ruin both field and crop through unbridled usage and unsustainable practices.

I won’t care if ten forty-something chickens stand gawking while they try to cover their transfer from dressed to swim-ready. I’ll either be truly comfortable in my own skin or so detached from it I won’t even feel naked. If my mind is sharp enough, I’ll probably think of this blog post and laugh at myself.

Rather, the “benefits” of membership are mainly domestic: aligning national economic policies with the WTO regime sets up the basis for improved economic efficiency and attracts companies eager to invest in these countries, not because of their market size, but to export to the neighbouring region.
The Cursed Earth - the first Dredd mega epic. It's where I properly fell in love with the art of Mick McMahon after initially being a Bolland only man! I love, love the Last president of the United States vampire story and still rate that segment as my favourite 2000AD strip.

That's the Craft Camp when you carefully plan and pack all your making stuff a couple of days in advance, only to find yourself half unpacking them the night before, because you're going to have to miss the first day and night to look after a sick child, so you may as well get on with some making in the meantime.
At thirteen someone loaned me a copy of “Christine” by Stephen King. From then on, and to this day, I read his work whenever I can.
- Philippines: It was well known the massive Japanese espionage activity in the country prior to the war. Japanese businesses were near every important bridge, electrical plant, and public utility, American military bases and communications stations. Japanese owners of huts near Camp Murphy in Manila had enough dynamite to blow up the city. A brewery had concealed a radio station that guided in Japanese warplanes. Even the Japanese consul and his staff informed Tokyo of warship movements, airport constructions, size of Philippine armed forces, number of American troops and aircraft.
Work is a blessing. Now before you cancel your subscription to the paper or use this page to wrap up dead fish, hear me out. Those who enjoy their jobs and don’t retire early actually live longer and have a better quality of life. Before you quit your existing job and look for something different, realize that sometimes it is just a different perspective or a change in attitude on your part that can make a world of difference in how you experience your current job. That being said however, vacation is a wonderful thing. I love my days off. I look forward to indulging my lazy side, sitting on the deck, lying in the hammock, fishing or just puttering around the house. Sometimes I have some difficulty fully expressing my lazy side but that isn’t because I don’t try.

She told me this morning to “call it” – to guess whether it’s a boy or a girl. I had to admit that I’ve been picturing her with a boy, although I don’t know why that is. A few months ago I was thinking that a girl would be more fun to shop for, but after spending time in baby stores and on baby websites, I now feel confident that there are adorable gifts to be had for babies of either sex.

I ask myself if something's fundamentally changed...and I don't think anything has. Yes, life is busy, but not any busier than it used to be. The Sensual Goddess still fully supports my blogging. I'm still both a mystic and a sensual beast, and I'm still growing and making discoveries about myself. The journey continues, the views are always interesting, and the companions to share those views are delightful.
I hope these little girls are learning that what they've done is gross and sad. I hope they're beginning to understand that, as they brush their real hair and show off their skinny little bodies, they're only showing how incredibly ugly they are. And if they don't understand that now - I can only hope that they will one day soon.

So as I said in my goodreads review, I'd give the book a 2 out of 5 stars, and the sex a 5! If your curious, read it. Honestly there are just too many good books out there to give too much time to this kind of fiction, in my opinion.

Like many gorgeous women, L is compelled to find an aspect of her looks to be hyper-critical about, and she has chosen one crooked canine to worry over; it’s a bit out of line, and it tends to make her smile slightly uneven, irreverent, cocky.

From Mark Kennedy's intelligence reports that were later disclosed to Ratcliffe defendants, we know he was recording things in minute detail, right down to people's biscuit preferences. The HMIC report's conclusion that he was going astray and that his superiors didn't know what this £5,000 a week asset was doing is just laughable.

The next way to flirt is with your body language. There are three elements to this, smile, stance and stare. If you will notice, the young lady to my left is constantly doing these three things. But there is a good way and a bad way to do this. Yeah, okay. With smiling, it’s just you have like strong teeth and a good way to do it is like kind of a little smile. And then you gotta have a strong stance like you’re holding your ground. You’re not like swaying all over the place. And then stare, like we don’t totally mean stare, we mean eye contact like two to four seconds and then look away. Even if you don’t have confidence, you’ll fake it with those three things.

Without even venturing into the subject of crime, it is quite clear that, in general black men are nowhere close to being Prince Charmings in their treatment of women, a fact supported by no less a figure than the US Democratic presidential candidate. Even without Obama's endorsement, white women must know the truth, particularly those who live in the inner cities, where the evidence is all around them.
President Obama came out of the closet, so to speak, on same-sex marriage. While I support him as President, I disagree with the president in this instance. Let me state further, that while I have voted in all presidential elections of late, there has not been one candidate for whom I have I voted that I have agreed with on all important theological issues, including President Obama. That being said, I believe President Obama has done an admirable job, all things considered. So, here are my two cents, for what its worth, on same-sex marriage:

To me there is no doubting Amis's sincerity, but he does seem to have some confusions and he really needs to watch his language. I do agree with him that there's a mistaken and dangerous 'liberal' inability to condemn horrors perceived to be confined to other cultures, but perhaps the 60% of an audience who failed to put up their hands when he asked how many would call themselves 'morally superior' to suicide bombers were simply shocked by his diction? It's one thing to condemn an action, but it's another to bring the focus back onto oneself and bathe in moral righteousness. Much of Amis's diction is hierarchical in this way: we in the west are more 'evolved' than Islamic states, he says (it's no good Amis claiming as he has that by 'evolved' he simply means 'more civilized': the word has inescapable Darwinian connotations of progression and hierarchy); Muslims need (and want) 'to put their house in order', he says, calling on Biblical and western-political notions of division and patriarchal hierarchy (and in danger of conflating Islam and Islamism once again.)

Obviously, I was angry at Paul for taking his sister out like that because although he didn’t understand how dangerous it was for them - Lise especially because of the cold but also them both, he could have walked them across the road when a car was coming.

5. Another issue, again nothing to do with my absence but just go with the stream of consciousness right now please, is my oven. More specifically the timer on the oven. When we moved here a year ago and did a little kitchen remodel on our new house, we got a new oven. Maytag. They are generally known for quality products yes? Well the stupid timer on said Maytag beeps 3 times in a row when it is done...and that is all. Done, will not beep again ever. Is it just me or is that wrong? Granted continuous beeping is somewhat annoying, but how about beeps at intervals until turned off? I NEED more beeps in order to not burn dinner.

Anyway, here is another photo of Casa Loma that really caught my eye when I was reviewing my photos of our visit. To me there is a bit of a keystoning perspective problem in this photo as well, but I actually like the effect and left it as is.

I have received so many requests from family, friends, and readers for our awesome Paris itinerary that I figured I should start off the week (of what I hope to be all about love and my love for this city) with the details of our trip. This was carefully crafted with the input many, and reviewed by someone who lives in the city... so you know it's the real deal! We were able to cover about 90% of the things on this list, and when I go back, I plan on doing all of them again!!! I hope this is something that you will be able to bookmark, just in case you find yourself stuck for 5 days in the most beautiful city on the planet!

Despite the raw material, Diterzi’s creation is no po-faced litany, but instead a vital body of music and lyrics that engage with the subject as though its ebb and flow was positive, uplifting even. She had been approached by Argentinean stage director Marcial Di Fonzo Bo with the idea of a show based around Luxemburg after he had seen her on stage. He’d been impressed with her full-on approach and, equally, she has engaged head on with his idea, creating ‘Rosa La Rouge’.

I didn't mind getting up early and walking the dogs first. They were ready to go too. I think they realized how gorgeous it was outside too. They were frisky and and happy as they bounded through their usual paces.

Christian Recovery leaders—participants in the International Christian Recovery Coalition, (www.ChristianRecoveryCoalition.com)–will come from the United States and Canada to share their programs, plans, and efforts to enhance recovery from alcoholism and addiction by reliance on the power of God. They will meet and speak in workshop fashion at His Place Church in Westminster, California, Friday, May 18 and Saturday May 19. Members of the public who believe, or wish to learn how, these maladies can be cured by reliance on the Creator are invited to register and attend. The Conference will emphasize the way early A.A. pioneers were, in their Akron A.A. Christian Fellowship, cured of alcoholism with God’s help in the 1930’s. All participant leaders and speakers are recovered, Christian alcoholics or addicts—with long term sobriety–who utilize “Old School” early A.A. First Century Christianity principles and practices in their respective Christian recovery endeavors.
I really don’t know where to begin in my views about the ending. To be clear, I am very disappointed with how the game ends but I’m not so livid to sign petitions to change the ending or burn up the official Bioware forums with my expression of hate for the endings. It’s already been done by enough people. Everyone practically knows that a huge majority of fans who have dedicated their time into this beloved game series are clearly upset. I may not have dedicated five years of my life to this series as I have just played all three games back-to-back since January of this year, but I can still understand the outrage.

You might be watching several advertisements on television about various types of watches and wondering that why so many people are crazy about them. Actually, many people prefer water resistant or water proof watches even if there are better looking designs in the market. If you are also looking to buy a watch that can handle water then it is better to know the difference before buying anything.

I’ve started to read Diet for a New America by John Robbins. If I weren’t already a vegan, I’d swear to avoid any and all animals products after reading the first chapter. Robbins outlines some of the ways in which different animals feel, think, bond, and have emotions (much like humans), and then points out some of the cruelty and inhumane torture that these animals suffer at the hands of humans. And then…he gets into the factory farming industry. I’m not sure I can stomach reading any further.
I adored the sopranos,never saw it when it was on tv at the time but bought the dvd box set and took six weeks to watch the lot ,I didn’t like the ending but made up my own mind what happened that suited me… Not what I know was meant to happen. Great series and sadly missed!

As police officers we have a vast network of resources to draw upon when faced with the situation of cyber bullying. Besides contacting other officers and SRO's in our networks we have a vast on line resouce pool to dip into. I'll list a few of them here for your use, these can also be helpful when you are faced with making a presentation sheet or pamphlet for hand out to a class, group, or to concerned parents at meetings or if a parent approaches you with this subject either in your office or out in the firld. I make it a point now to carry a couple of copies in my " go bag", you never know when the need may arise and with today's attitudes in the department as to pro-active policing they are a great addition. As many of us on the job know not all Officers are created equal and some are " retired on the job" take the opportunity to give a couple of copies to our colleagues, a bit of motivation never hurts and who knows..maybe they'll get excited enough to get back into the ' swing of things' instead of just waiting to get vested for pension..!!

Though I wanted to cry, I didn't. This teacher had broken me of crying on the first day of school, when she threatened me - a child who had just walked in the door and had not previously been away from my mother longer than an hour - by saying she would send me to the principal's office if I didn't stop crying, and that I would be in Big Trouble. I had learned that school was a scary, unsafe and mean place, and I learned that crying was only an annoying weakness in my teacher's eyes. So I rarely cried in kindergarten, even though I frequently had reason to.

CONFIDING IN HIM.
This quote kills me. Reading through that issue of the Watchtower brought a few tears to my eyes. This man is saying, “Music.. drinking… drugs… hair…. beard… clothes….” When Jesus is whispering in his ear, “I’m here. Choose me, choose me, choose me. I created you. I love you. I want you to be mine. Will you trust me enough to let me be your God? Your King? Your owner? Your lover? Your best friend? Your confidante?”

A few views of the crib bedding. I DIY'd most of this after an exhaustive search for some cute, non-girly yellow & gray crib bedding.

I’m self-aware enough to know I’m projecting a little here. And over generalizing, maybe just a smidge. A couple of weeks after my ex fiancé and I broke up, I recall someone asking me, “Do you think he’s changed?” In that moment, my “people don’t change” theory was born. So, I apologize if my tone is a little alienating – I’m working through some stuff here.

Beside my shortbread, there was yum strawberry fresh cream cake glowing, no wonder she hardly had a look at my shortbread. Even-though her mum tried to convince her she didn't bother much as she was licking clean her mum's cake. I wasn't sad but was smiling all the way and enjoying the cake aswell, but others were happy with my creations.
People may ask for your honest opinion, but if you are tempted to give an honest and objective assessment, do it with empathy and do it gently. After all, you don’t know what somebody else has been through and what they have had to overcome to create the art they are now presenting for your consideration. They are not fools. They put their best efforts, their heart, their soul and lots of love into creating their work. It may have special and deep personal significance to them. It might represent something very dear to them. This might be the very first time they have conquered their fear, put in the time and the effort to produce something that they are beginning to feel confident about. Their nascent confidence may be a fragile bud that has only just emerged. What they want is some affirmation for all that effort, mingled with a few tips and secrets to carry them forward on their artistic journey of discovery.

Suffering refines the Church and each one of her members so as to strengthen their faith. Trials and tribulations will in fact produce steadfastness in our hearts as we endure to the end (James 1:2). God ordains suffering so as to refine our faith and teach us to truly trust in and rely on Him. We are proven to be true Christians by our steadfastness in our confidence in Christ and our boasting in our hope in Him through suffering (Hebrews 3:6). Do not be mistaken, suffering will most definitely come our way sometimes in very harsh and hurtful ways. However, evidence of those who are truly partaking of Christ’s salvation will endure to the end. Genuine believers will not become hardened to the truth and hope of the gospel during suffering, but instead persevere. God uses trials and suffering to display and identify[1] His true Church. Perseverance through suffering for the Christian will produce a confidence and assurance in their faith and hope in Christ for salvation. One can therefore self-identify if they are true believers or not. If during suffering they harden their hearts against God and turn from Him, they may not be true believers since true believers will persevere in faith and obedience even through suffering as they are empowered by Christ to do so.

My first choice is always the music of Alex North. His magnificent score for Cleopatra – which was released in its entirety about a decade ago – will instantly put me into the writing mode. As the playwright Arthur Miller once said, “Alex North can break your heart in three notes.” What’s also interesting is the fact that North studied under Prokofiev when he went to the USSR in the thirties. At times he is jarringly dissonant, at other times lyrical. But he never becomes sentimental or gauche; his supreme intelligence always shines through. His music is everything I want to accomplish with my prose. I’ve written many a page to his wonderful music, and I heartily encourage you to listen to all his works. Perhaps you’ll be inspired, too.

Together, with my brother and his friend, we went down the new Iloilo City flood way, and was surprised to see scenic views of ricefields and farm plantations blissfully transitioning into cityscapes as we rode under the pleasant morning sun.

We got separated in 4th grade due to each of our older sisters going into Jr. High School. The Jr. High was over crowded and going through an expansion so they instituted a year-round policy. The student population was divided into 4 "tracks" and rotated on a 12 week cycle. This meant that at any given time, 1/4 of the students were on a 3 week break. It would work out like this; go to school 9 weeks get 3 weeks off. Connie's older sister was put on Green Track and my older sister was put on Red Track and so we would go weeks without really seeing each other during the days.
In the aroma, the crystal malts of the Pale overshadow the roasted malts of the Porter, but only barley ... barely. The slightly piney hops in the pale do make a difference in breaking through the thick malt. It's a bit too sharp in the spiky malts.

Documents show that the earliest black slaves in Cape Town were brought from Angola, not from the North and East of what is now South Africa; laws dating from the 1820s forbade residents of Port Elizabeth and surrounds from employing Xhosas. Of course, this was as much for the benefit of the colonists as for the locals, but nonetheless the early administrators were savvy enough to foresee problems with the 'natives'.

One of the problems facing the small business operator today, nudist or not, is knowing which way to turn with branding and marketing. Frankly, there is too much information available. What’s my solution? More information, of course! But here’s the difference: I’m going to share with you some insights into branding, marketing, business communications, graphics and Web design that have their foundation in something we know, love and share: nudism. You are reading the first in what will be a series of posts, and perhaps even an e-book, showing how you can “Use the Lessons of Nudism to Shamelessly Build Your Brand and Market Your Business (in an Age of Exposure and Transparency).”
From here on in the film essentially becomes a classic car chase flick as the hapless couples spend the rest of the movie trying desperately to get to the safety of Amarillo but at every step of their journey they are dogged by the satanic version of the Anthill Mob, unhelpful law enforcement officers, weird trailer park residents wearing so much polyester they certainly must be a fire hazard and sinister gas station attendants and librarians. I think it’s fair to say that the film only really finds its feet when the action sequences begin, shotguns are fired out of windows at high speed, cars are driven for miles on two wheels, stuff explodes, Satanists career off bridges and Peter Fonda consistently sports some the of finest 70s shirts mankind has ever witnessed.

Two weeks ago, I was in Target on a Sunday. Always a bad idea. People were everywhere, and I was close to loosing my mind. Even a short trip for a quick errand had turned epic. Barreling toward the exit, a child darted out in front of me. “Holy crap” was the first thing out of my mouth, then I realized I had not hit the girl. A mother chased after the child, grabbed her by the arm, and shouted at me “you should have hit her. Then she may have learned something” – then smacked the little girl.
Blogger fail, as I mixed up the order of my swatches, but as you can see in the photo above, both blushes are a similar shade. Azalea Blossom has a more matte, powdery finish, while Giggly has not only more pigmentation, but also a light shimmery finish one associates with mineralized products. Overall do you need both? Probably not.

Muddy Waters - The Complete Plantation Recordings (1941-42), Martin Scorcese Presents The Blues (1941-64), and Muddy Waters At Newport (1960). Everyone's favorite cuddly bluesguy, Muddy Waters was one of the first to put Delta blues together with electric guitars, and thus epitomizes what most of America thinks about when they think about the blues. The Plantation Recordings includes his first recordings from the 40s and are acoustic, sounding much like Son House and Robert Johnson. The Scorcese collection leaps from one of these Plantation songs into the electric Chicago blues that made Waters his name. The Newport album is a barnburning live set. I don't know that I want or need any more Muddy Waters, though.

My first little man turned the big 5 on the 14th. It seems like just yesterday we were celebrating Trey's 1st birthday when he was just toddling around and starting to grow teeth...now he's our little kindergartner learning to read & write.
Here is the real bumper though, for me, it seems. I heard the phrase “your birthparents loved you soooo much, that they . . . ,” and you can fill in the blank about placing me with parents who could provide well for me/give me what I needed. So, when I felt compelled (as never before) to seek out these birthparents who “loved me so much,” never in a million years did I expect to be rejected again. I thought they would be so happy that I found them, or that they had maybe been looking for me–that they would be as happy to know that I was alive as I was to find out from an initial report that they were alive.

With Indian Festivals round the corner you can whip up some quick and easy sweets as offerings. It can be your usual prasadams or any sweets that you can offer on the festival day.

I've also been waiting for the delivery of some net curtain wire to hang curtains for the playhouse outside (thank you Sue for your suggestion!) I wasn't able to find any net curtain wire in the US - so I got it from an e-bay shop in the UK. The curtains are made from 2 yards of cotton I got years ago but never used - I don't think I ever liked the pattern but I think it works well for the little house.

Though the lodge arranges excursions, including trips out to swim with whale sharks, I chose to spend my time reading alone on the beach with nothing in sight but coconut trees and an endless expanse of aquamarine water. I was happy to be disturbed only when summoned for meals centered around the catch of the day — turmeric-scented, beer-battered squid one evening; hot green chiles atop fresh filets of a local snapper known as chugu the next.

Last night Felecia and I rinsed out our growler and walked to Laurelwood in hopes of trying their Fresh Hopped Kolsch. I read recently, on a blog that now alludes me, that guys at Laurelwood drove south in the Willamette valley and picked up a truckload of fresh hops which they rushed back to the brewery to transform into beer that very same day. This little story is very exciting for me, and I longed to enjoy the exploits of their hops odyssey.
But wait, where is Apple? While Amazon and Google have managed to win a short sprint outpacing Apple by few months, both of their cloud music services have already been heavily criticized, both by the unhappy music industry and from consumers, who have found the quality of the services to be lacking. Such approach could send music content providers rushing into Apple’s arms. And if recent reports are to be believed, Apple has signed a cloud-music licensing deal with EMI Music, and is close to similar deals with UMG and Sony Music Entertainment.

During their first visit, Graham and Isaacs traveled up the coast, visited shelters and talked to thousands of people who were alone and scared. Many had questions about why this happened. They blamed themselves for having a home in the wrong location, being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Some wondered if they were being punished by God. They wondered what tomorrow would hold.

Burke also quotes the ‘counterterror strategists’ who have argued that the ‘radicalisation of young Muslim men may be ebbing’. Well, who would trust these people, at least here in the UK? These ‘experts’ needed a few bombs in their own backyards before they even had an inkling of the Islamist and terrorist threat. For years the experts and counter-terrorists thought that British Islamists were either a bunch of clowns or that they were too interested in foreign battles to cause much damage here at home. It is strange, then, that Burke has so much faith in people who nearly always got it wrong in the past about radical Islam. It seems that Burke’s three years or so of stability has given the experts yet another reason for thinking that all is well at home. Perhaps the experts pay too much attention to Guardian journalists like Burke rather than wondering the streets of Bradford or the Islamic Societies of so many British universities.

"The only measure by which we will be judged by the people who come after is the health of the land base, because that is what is going to support them. They are not going to give a shit whether or not we were pacifists; they are not going to give a shit if we supported Israel or we didn't support Israel; whether we voted green or democrat or republican or not at all. What they are going to care about is whether they can drink the water, whether they can breathe the air, whether the land can support them. One of the important questions is to ask what does the land need from you." Derrick Jensen

At any rate, Peter Reinhart's book The Bread Baker’s Apprentice has a hefty share of free-form loaves, so I inevitably get some practice as I make my way through the book as part of the Bread Baker's Apprentice Challenge - an endeavor that I am still erratically pursuing, although I will be skipping the part of the challenge that deals with sourdough starters. It's a bit too much of a challenge for me right now! Anyway, enough digression.
According to Inv. B.W. Himan’s notes, Mangum described at least two of her attackers in ways didn’t remotely resemble any of the lacrosse players. No wonder, then, that she identified none of the suspects that police presented to her in photo line-ups on March 16 and March 21. On March 16, police presented four groups of six lacrosse players each. In each group was one suspect named Adam, Matt, or Brett (the police selected only 2 of the 3 Matts on the team as suspects) and five fillers (players not named Adam, Matt, or Brett). On March 21, police showed the accuser two more groups, with one suspect apiece (the other two residents of the house, Dave Evans and Dan Flannery) and five lacrosse players as fillers. In total, Mangum viewed 36 of the 46 white lacrosse players and identified no one as an attacker.
Of course the cinnamon roll is delicious and a showy presentation in itself, but for our family, the tradition of making it together means much more.
I have missed you all. What happened? Well. What happened is that for a long, long time, this blog was fueled by a narrative. A story. A bad and terrible story, yes, but people want to know how it ended. Now that it has ended, good heavens what is left for us all to say to each other.

Hey, guess what? Blizzard pulled it off. The female panda’s are adorable. I knew the Asian themed areas would be stunning, that was never a concern, but they were even more stunning than I had hoped. I won’t go into much detail here for those who are trying to halfway avoid spoilers but I got instantly excited just seeing the changes to the character creation screens. Once I got my Pandaren looking all cute, I had to name her. I couldn’t use Elfi in my name since a Pandaren is not an Elf, but I did want it to be as recognizable as possible because I know there are a lot of people from my Google Reader and Twitter feeds on the Lost Isles server where I am. I finally came up with Jadeindale as a pretty good combination of an Asian themed name and something that’s a part of my normal naming convention. I know I won’t be spending a lot of time logged into the beta, but if you are there and ever run into Jadeindale feel free to give me a wave or a hug.

For judging those who perhaps consciously and inadvertently have harmed you, or have harmed the collective, or who have harmed Gaia, or who have harmed those you love. Let us forgive together today.

I seem to remember telling you that unless you had flowers not to return. I saw no flowers or candy in your mouth this morning when you stood on my front porch barking and asking if Lily and Sadie could come out to play. Something tells me you have not so nice intentions with my girls.. please do not come back we are not interested in your kind here. Sure, your cute and all but my girls can NOT come out and play.

First, to appease wary locals afraid to try new things, the menu always features Suntory's The Premium Malts and an Ebisu. Other staples are Ise Kadoya's four main brews: Shinto Beer, Brown Ale, Stout, and Pale Ale. Occasionally, as with last night, one spot is given to an Ise Kadoya seasonal. This month it has been their Imperial Wheat Ale, which is a bit too light and sweet for my taste.
I did a recording of my talk Against The Current, for the wonderful website The Unschooler Experiment, about a month ago. The Unschooler Experiment sets itself apart from pretty much all other unschooling sites in that it focuses on the stories and experiences of grown unschoolers themselves, instead of parents, and seeks to share information that's interesting and relevant to both grown unschoolers and parents of unschoolers (and grown unschooled parents of unschoolers, of course!).
If there is any wrong note in the movie, it is by Thornbury as Jody, Mike's older brother. Maybe because he plays it too jocularly, with too broad a smile, too feathered a mane of hair, too Californian an attitude. I realize why he does, but maybe this is a result of a movie telegraphing its punches too clearly. Or maybe not. This isn't insurmountable, under the circumstances; after all, Jody is a character to whom Mike looks up as his big brother, so any beatification of his actions would be understandable. But playing a character in a horror flick like one straight out of a McDonald's commercial may not have been the right choice. Then again, how many actors in McDonald's ads go around with women's panties in their mouths?

Oh! Let me tell you about the lemon water real quick. This is a tip that Leandro posted on the Team Beachbody website. He said that when we're not eating healthy our bodies can lean more toward an acidic pH level (because pretty much all unhealthy food is on the acidic side of the pH scale) and that can make it so the body holds on to fat. So he recommends that for the first four days on the plan we drink water with fresh squeezed lemon because lemon is surprisingly very alkaline. On day one we're supposed to squeeze one lemon into a glass of water, day two is two lemons, day three is three lemons, and day four is four whole lemons. Just the two lemons today was pretty freaking sour, so I'm thinking that tomorrow and the next day I will just squeeze one lemon into a glass of water and drink that many glasses.
Finally, I have a miscellaneous bag with multi-coloured yarns and different textures (and a little mouse peeking out!)
In conclusion, I think as those interested in ministry we should begin to ask God to lead us to our mentor. If you have already had a biblical mentoring experience maybe you are finding that God is calling you to find your own mentee. I have been thinking about my own mentor, wherever they are thinking about all the things that I will learn and be able to use to bless others, maybe they are even now longingly searching for someone to pass down their own knowledge and wisdom to, but I know in due time God will lead me to them.
The rebound- a quick fix remedy for a broken heart? After years of constant failed relationships, battered self-esteem and endless doubt the rebound has become a sort of thearpy for me, after every partner I cared about left I would go on an endless search to make myself feel better by finding other people who do actually want me. Well that’s what I would tell myself after one too many shots and the option to take the reasonable looking guy offering me endless amounts of attention home with me it’s safe to say I veered of the rails slightly. I thought those days of justifying behaving like a common whore were behind me, for the past few months I had been happily committed (in ironically an uncommited relationship) to one person, for weeks the fear of sleeping with anyone else scared the life out of me… And then everything I had become used to came crashing down around me.

I know, I know, I've been neglecting you. I've spent the last couple of months actually, y'know, being Frugal. It's the not having any money that does it. Most of the hobby I've done has been other people's, for money, although I did find the time for a quick Warmachine tournament and I do have a NEW PROJECT on the go too. Incidentally, if you happen to have some models that you want painted and can't be bothered with doing yourself, drop me a line here or via GAME OVER and we'll have a chat.

While it is easy to criticize the online model, with its myriad dropouts and technical challenges, it promises to radically democratize a traditionally elitist and anti-democratic model. It even promises to educate its students better than the traditional university does. Whether you find this change exhilarating or frightening, there is no denying that something has to give. Student loan debts now exceeds even credit card and auto loan debt. The old model for higher education threatens our livelihoods and cannot continue unchanged. The future of our economy and our nation depends on radical transformation.
One of the most striking aspects about the coverage of the massacre was how the Zionist media were quick to ascribe it to terrorists, despite the alternative explanations available (revenge killing by a Thai worker, retribution for the killing of 2 Palestinian children near the settlement two years ago...). Not only that, but the whole Palestinian people were dehumanized in op-ed after op-ed, despite the Palestinian Authority's condemnation of the murders. In some cases the demonization reached cosmic levels. I was particularly shocked by a Hanoch Daum article at Ynet under the title These are not humans:

Jordan makes the connection explicit as Erica, like Simone in the earlier film, is caught in the reflection of a car's rear-view mirror. Unlike other shots in which Erica is acknowledging her own psychological metamorphosis from liberal-minded media personality to skulking night-time avenger, this moment - as with the moment in Mona Lisa - provides the audience with enough room to consider the effect that this world with its cruelty, apathy and sense of moral decay has had on these characters; allowing us to question, personally and individually, whether the end really justifies the means.

Quick Oscar moment: thanks to all involved writers from start (2008) to finish (2012). And above all, lonely at the top: huge thanks to all hip hop enthusiasts, musical schizophrenics, fans, anonymous leechers, supporters and people who were active in the tight MS community. At day one I was under the assumption that I was one of the only people with "such a weird/eclectic taste in music". It's amazing to see that there's a (fairly big) worldwide niche full of lovers of 'jazz-hop' and analogue cross-overs.
And the ones who made this all possible, Mom and Dad.
I like that this poem brings up that common truth of wanting to be acknowledged, respected, and the typical human nature of trying to impress others even if there is nothing to impress with. It takes the human struggle and places it in the cab driver’s perspective yet anyone can relate to this poem, everyone knows someone who tries so hard to impress others and fails. The truth is in the details here, the holes in the shoes, the unshaven faces, the same cluster of people all going home to struggle on their own yet still wanting to outshine each other in some way, even a small way. I like this poem.

We haven't had the camper out since September of last year, and everyone is excited at the prospect of a few days in the woods. It's always a nice, quiet retreat away from my self-imposed electronic attachment, and usually seems to signal my getting back into the studio and getting some quality work done. I hope it works this time, as well.

The historical use of picture books were brought about by Noel Harrington. It was made cheaply as wartime books, by printing the whole book on one sheet of paper and folded in a certain way to make the book form. each page alternated in colour from full colour to black and white. it was printed directly from a lithographic stone and each colour was individually painted.

For three years now, people have been reading about the midlife transition from corporate life to teaching in the public schools of New Orleans that my wife and I made in 2008. After reading my recent post on some of the more positive (a relative term, to be sure) student interactions of the past year, my friend Kay (a follower of this saga from day one) sent me a response e-mail which simply said, “Okay….now I’m beginning to get it”…

Gerald Moore's achievements as an accompanist are well-known, but I can find out little about Fritz Kitzinger, who copes splendidly with the very demanding piano part in the Bloch Suite. He seems to have been a vocal coach and conductor as well as a pianist; he married the noted piano pedagogue Adele Marcus in 1940. On records he also appeared as an accompanist for Charles Kullman, Ezio Pinza, and Friedrich Schorr, but this is his only collaboration with William Primrose.

The simple and disappointing answer is ‘no.’
It has never been anything but a religion of the ambitious, dominating, and unscrupulous, with either a race or a caste arrogation of superiority over the races without or the herd within, an assumption of licence to act treacherously and injuriously towards aliens and those it deems of inferior breed and to confine its standards of honour and decency to those of its own blood or order. It is a code that Christianity has actively and passively resisted for two thousand years. That fact is not unimportant. For between the progress that has culminated in ergosophy and the Christian religion there is an intimate connection. Indeed the former is in origin wholly the product of the Christian nations of the West.

So yeah, I was not directed to be comfortable with wearing make-up. I can remember very rare times when my sister and I (or was it just me?) wore áo dài, powder, eye shadows, lipsticks, and heels from my mother (she didn’t wear make-up but she did receive make-up products as gifts) when we were very small. And perfume. (My father has passion for perfume. Probably I “inherited” it from him : p. I still remember one time my mother once received a box of powder with peach scent that I was so head over heels with its sweet and soft smell. When I think about it now, I still like it a lot. I mean, a lot.) From these very little things, with how few people around me who were interested in make-up (let alone use it, and look beautiful with it on), it’s difficult to explain why I have this special fondness in make-up.

It's not a record for a bright, sunny summer August day. For a chilly, windswept January winterscape, or blustery, rainy fall day with the onset of a brutal winter on the horizon, it's perfect. And while some songs individually are standouts, it's a record best enjoyed as a piece.

It’s simple, really. Very, very few people are going to look at the news of the preliminary autopsy results this morning, when they open up their paper or turn on the morning news, and NOT think: You know, that could have waited until Henry was laid to rest today. People that knew him or his family, people that don’t, and pretty much everyone else with any sense of common decency.
Bauckham downplays these relatively insignificant arguments and gives priority to the prominent themes in Revelation – which are life-changing.
He was young, and his expression was less like a man and more like an old beached ship-worn by waves and salt, yet refusing to just simply slip back out into the sea and disappear.

The good news is Jesus Christ; how that He “died for our sins according to the scriptures; and that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures.” No, we don’t relate to man’s sin but rather to the righteousness of Jesus Christ. He can and will save all who come to Him by faith.

So, when Nadia and I started out this month, we had thrown together a last minute idea hoping for the best. What we got was an overwhelming response and an indescribable group of women that have touched my heart in more ways than I can count. So overwhelming, in fact, that we actually have a few days scheduled in June to fill out the overflow!

This transparent Pet may be one of a kind. It can't be used because the film would be exposed, but it looks to be operational. It may have been a demonstration model. It is also an early model Pet. This sold for 39,500 yen! though having seen regular Pets go for $400 on eBay, maybe it doesn't seem so expensive.

A blog created by NY literary agent extraordinaire Janet Reid, Query Shark takes queries and viciously rips them to shreds.

Now, talking about the actual model. At first I didn’t like it for some reason. Maybe it’s because I had been staring at the classic version the whole time. I wasn’t a fan of his fluff to be honest either. But getting the new model out and getting it ready, it really impressed me with it’s size and overhauled detail. He really does look like a mountain of a man compared to the other warcasters like he’s supposed to. Plus that pose! You know I’m a fan of dynamic poses on miniatures!

For many years it was believed that the first map to mention the names of the mountains of Machu Picchu and Huayna Picchu was that drawn by the French explorer Charles Wiener in 1875, although he labelled the mountains the wrong way round. The previous year he had travelled to the Urubamba valley and once he had reached the town of Ollantaytambo he received information from the locals that fine Inca ruins lay further up the valley at a place called “Huaina-Picchu or Matcho-Picchu.” Upon hearing this he left to try to find these ruins by travelling, via a pretty circuitous route due to their being no other possible path at that time, up through the Panticalla pass and the Lucumayo valley to reach the same Choquechaca bridge that Antonio Raimondi had visited 16 years previously. From Choquechaca Wiener then decided to head further down-river, towards the plantation of Santa Ana rather than up-river which would have taken him towards Machu Picchu because of the difficulties heading in that directions would bring.

Yes! Fall is all about crisp air, longer nights, and the beginning of the holiday season, so you need to create warmth. Start by changing out the curtains – I’d go with velvet, silk or heavy canvas in a deep hue. I like charcoal grey, navy or black, myself. (I know it sounds heavy, but there’s a formality to darker window dressings that seems to fit the season – and you can always add bright color via pillows and rugs.)
Mr Cheung recalled that he was invited by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) to come to Hollywood. There, he familiarised himself with the Three-Act Structure, which is a success formula to make a blockbuster movie. But, as Mr Cheung explained, it can be applied to reach his goal, namely to use IP trade to drive stakeholders' economic development. In Act I the context is given, Act II the challenge, and Act III the resolution. I am sure that the Hong Kong movie scene uses a similar scheme to keep the audiences captivated. Those Chinese from the Mainland, versed in Marxism, might recall the different acts as Hegel's thesis, anti-thesis, synthesis, respectively. So if Act I is the setting whereby Hong Kong is introduced as a Special Administrative Region with the ambition to become a regional knowledge hub, Act II is the challenge of how to get there? In other words, how to apply IP, how to monetise these intangible assets? Mr Cheung was inspired by a Japanese car manufacturer who was not interested in cars, but in the money that you can make with cars. This same approach should be followed with IP. (IP Dragon wonders whether it is really possible to exploit IP, without really loving it?). MBAs teach you many interesting things but not about the role of intangibles, Mr Cheung said. Therefore, we need to map out our niche, and make an inventory of what is already available, predict change, seize opportunity and collaborate to innovate, and execute these processes in parallel. Because, we live in an IP economy, Mr Cheung told. The significance becomes clear when one looks at the most valuable brand in the world: Coca-Cola (71,861 million U.S. dollar, according to Interbrand in October 2011). If all tangibles are destroyed, Coca-Cola could resurrect itself because of the worth of its intangibles. IP can be lucrative, even though it is sometimes tiny. For example Mr Cheung knows the composer of the two second jingles.

Since he believes he’s in Elfland, where no mortal who wishes to escape must eat or drink, he is doubly determined to resist all offers of food.
What I love about this film are the characters. Drew Barrymore is as cute as ever or should I say, cute lady with a foul-mouth. Her boy-toy, Justin Long, marked this film as his leading man debut. We cannot deny the chemistry between the two. C’mon, the kissing scenes with tongue, who does that? Most films fake kissing scenes, that is, without tongue, but they dated so I guess it’s okay.

It was a crippling sort of shyness that hindered me from expressing myself and connecting with people. I’d try to clear my throat and attempt to say something. Screech. Stop. Silence. My shyness would let me hear a brake screeching to a halt, gridlocked in the traffic of doubts, ensuring that my voice would be there, on a standstill, jammed at the back of my throat.

The blank stare on my face is interrupted by the whistling between Gonzalo and don Miguel, who are singing aloud in a childish, sing-song manner with each other, “la mierda pequeña, la mierda pequeña.” Steve laughs out loud when he makes out their lyrics, and turns to me to gauge my reaction. I’m unsure of how to react, so I don’t. However, they continue singing and laughing while looking at me, so I ask Steve what they’re saying.

Once you have your hardware assembled, upload the following sketch. Now for desk jockeys such as myself, there is a catch, as a GPS receives signals from satellites the receiver will need to be in line of sight with the open sky. If you have your desk next to a window, or a portable computer you’re in luck. Look at the LED on your GPS receiver – if it is blinking, it has a lock (this is what you want); on - it is searching for satellites; off - it is off (!). Frankly I though it would blink for searching, and be on for satellite lock. Moving along…

Next I gotta say I really dig this t-shirt. I like it's minimalist design just a black background with the logo off to the side. It's like you can show that you're a comic book and or Checkmate fan with out looking like a nerd at the same time which could make all the difference between a fanboy who might as well be a born again virgin and one who actually has some kind of sex life.

The new forgiveness of the masses is now bestowed upon a certain Ross Barkley esquire. We have barely seen anything of the boy however the clamour for him to start every game is ridiculous. In the games he has played he has done ok but nothing exceptional yet. But our insatiable hunger for a new hero warps our perceptions of a young player still finding his feet and recovering from an horrific injury. Each pass he misplaces is instantly forgiven. he is young, at least he’s trying. Great idea, almost pulled it off. How long this lasts for I know not, however the perception pendulum for young Ross is currently at its peak. I only hope he is prepared for when it begins to swing the other way.

As a psychology grad student, I know that this behavior - the re-evaluation of a commitment during that in-between time after deciding to commit (e.g., engagement) and before the commitment becomes finalized (e.g., marriage) - is completely normal. It happens with small decisions and large, good decisions and bad; this psychological reflex does not discriminate, particularly if you have a pragmatic style of thinking.
And here is the card I made. I forgot all about this 2-pc Quickutz bell die I've had for a long time, so I used it for the main focus of the card.

I added some tiny ivory pearls from Pizzazz Aplenty inside the holes on the bell as well as on the punched border. The gold-embossed sentiment is by SNSS and I used BoBunny dsp throughout, with some dark green cardstock for the SB scalloped circle. The main circle was sponged with Ranger antique linen ink, and the gold ribbon is from my stash. The bell is popped up on dimensionals.

I watched a documentary recently about foreign aid from the developed countries to the third world countries. The statistics about the strings attached to such aids as well as the interests on debts costs so much that these third world countries have no prayer of recovering and developing if they honour the repayments and interest payments on such debts. These debts are linked to austerity measures and structural adjustment programs that seem to incapacitate the countries more in the end than they would have been had the help not been offered. For every aid or debt given, a greater amount is taken out. The dilema for the third world countries is that they have no immediate ways out of their crisis which does not depend in one way or another on foreign intervention. Often foreign trade is so unfairly done that earnings will never be enough without it being supplemented by debts or aids.
Still, for written copy that one supposes has been reviewed more than once, I get critical. In my mind. Not out loud.

Sloes are tart, plum-like fruits culled from hedgerow bushes called blackthorn. In rural parts of the British Isles and isolated spots in North America, the berries are pricked (or sometimes frozen to break down cell walls), then immersed in sugar or syrup and gin, vodka, or other spirits for a long maturation. Regardless of the spirit used, the resulting cordial is a stillroom favorite always dubbed sloe gin.

While there is the potential to make a good showing next year in the metric mile, I’m much more concerned about our prospects moving forward in the 800 meters. We only have one athlete running under 1:44.00 (Nick Symmonds, 1:43.83) in an event that typically finds the best athletes UNDER 1:43 in an Olympic season. Which means getting into a position to medal will be near impossible unless the pace goes very slow – something almost unlikely to happen with David Rudisha and Abubaker Kaki in the race.

J.K Rowling, who may have single-handedly inspired a whole generation of kids to love books, had her first Harry Potter book rejected by a dozen publishers (including Penguin and HarperCollins).

So, was with King David, when King David goes before the Lord, the Lord God forgave all his sins and remember them no more. God saw Jesus Christ who was to come, during the times of King David, Jesus Christ had not come yet, but because of Jesus Christ who was to come, who has now come for the forgiveness of all the sins of all people, the Adultery and Murdering that King David did was forgiven, Washed Cleansed, Pure and Made Holy. During those days the Blood of the lamb was used to represent the Blood of Jesus Christ, but since Jesus Christ came to die for all people and shed His blood on the Cross once and for all, even today all our sins are forgiven for whoever believe in Jesus Christ. In the Bible, (Hebrews 10:10) , we find that “We have been made holy through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.”

Finally, the third problem not only affects you but also other spies on your team; those pretty statues, while sometimes put into hilarious postures, are basically a flashing reminder to your enemies to spycheck more; on top of that, to expect the spy to use a spycicle and deal with him accordingly (as described above). They’re paranoia generators, and as any good spy will tell you, paranoia is your biggest enemy.
Cliff, along with his daughter Hilaire Richey Kallendorf, wrote ACING DEPRESSION: A TENNIS CHAMPION'S TOUGHEST MATCH, which was published by New Chapter Press in 2010. Cliff uses the book – and his mental health advocacy talks, to help educate people about depression and provide for hope of improving their lives.

According to Staf de Wilde the Catholic church is standing in front of a firm dogmatism and for a pyramidal, say dictatorial structure in which the basis church has to squeak little or nothing. Him remains it surprising that critical religious people within this institute wishes to remain active. According to him an organized belief community does not really has to be church with the qualities of the church of Rome. And as you take away these qualities, then you hold something else over: something resembling the original Christianity perhaps, at that time there did not exist yet an infallible pope and yet no dogmas.
This shutting of the door is significant in several ways.
Remember that we live in New Hampshire, and this being the high holy season of a Presidential Primary, we have access to all of the potential candidates. It’s not unusual for me to get several invites every week to see and ask questions of those who are running. I can go to Holiday walks, living room meetings, and even chili fests (to this day, my kids will tell you that John Kerry had the best chili ever.) And of course, when I’m wearing my journalistic hat, I even get to join the press corps to get interviews (have I told you how I was almost arrested when President Obama came to a town hall event because I had inadvertently followed his car too closely after the event?)
Take client photos frequently, as images and video drive the viral nature of social network. Digital cameras know take still images and video. Make sure that the images are professional looking and truly show highly skilled images. Have a model release ready to have the client sign-off so you can post the images to your blog, #Pinterest, #website, or#Facebook. Remember, those images just stay relevant at that time they were posted, frequency is key. Just don’t’ post once a day, several times a day is important.
The Angel Therapy Handbook is a ‘vital reference tool that you can refer to again and again’, the critic’s say. “Another Angel book by Doreen?” I hear you say. Aaahhh, but this time it’s different. THIS TIME Doreen gives you handy tools, knowledge and wisdom to tuck away in your Angel tool box.

I believe that we evolve naturally toward this one­ self if we allow it to happen. We begin our lives vulner­able and depend on our parents to feed us, clean us, and comfort us. When we need these things, we cry to get our needs met. Survival is our primary concern; we are always surveying for danger and seeking safety as we age.
I studied English Literature and Language at Oxford University and learnt lots about analysing books and talking about them. After I left uni, I worked for a year going to state schools around the country talking to young people about higher education and its benefits. I realised how important books were to raising aspirations and how they had raised my aspirations as a child without me even really noticing! After that epiphany, I knew I wanted to work with books—writing them and editing them.

The concept first took shape when one of their research subjects abruptly expired. They had never seen anything like it. To see that moment when the light dimmed from the subjects eyes was more exhilarating then he had anticipated. His colleagues were equally captivated by the process. What was it like for them in that moment ? What did they feel in that moment while their brain began shutting down? They discussed it relentlessly, researched the subject of death in poetry, pictures, medical journals but nothing compared to actually being witness to it. When the project was first suggested he argued over the relevance of such an undertaking but as a scientist his thirst for knowledge and the excitment over having a new puzzle to solve finally won out. They planned it out carefully setting several guidelines the first of which was to see to it that none of their subjects was caused any undue pain. Sometimes however he saw fear in the subjects eyes and he wondered why they feared what was happening? Wasn’t it just a transition from one state to another? He questioned whether or not the experiment was causing the subjects mental anguish and suggested that perhaps they should consider doing the study on a lower species but his colleagues argued that an unintelligent creature would only reveal the physical transition between life and death and that only a high functioning specimen had the capability to articulate the mental process they under went at the point of death. What did the subject feel at the moment of death? What was their last conscious thought? Why did they fear their death? A lower life form had no way to answer those things the way a human specimen could.

At work I had the craziest project. There were seventeen power-point projects created by a team of people that after they were generated someone pointed out that maybe they should all be on the same template. Cart before horse, anyone? So step one was picking a template that was easy to manipulate with our logo and a few other details. Step two was to get everyone to agree said template was good enough (amazingly, one round of emails with no dessent). It took two days to migrate the modified template into each of the documents and then change some spacing issues in each one. DONE.... whew
Justice sources say three of the 34 accused will not face criminal charges but will be released on so-called "peace bonds" ordering them to have no contact with fellow gang members. The remaining 31 are facing a variety of charges, including drug trafficking, conspiracy, money laundering, participating in a criminal organization and obstruction of justice. All of those who have been arrested will make their first court appearance this morning in Winnipeg. Manitoba Attorney General Andrew Swan said Wednesday's arrests are just the beginning.

Anyway, Tuesday the plumber came and assessed the situation. Wednesday the pipes were replaced. Thursday they did leak checks (oh and now my living room is completely covered in tarps) and said they had to leave the ceiling open for another whole week just to be sure and to air it out. I spent most of that week living solely in my bedroom, which is full of my kitchen stuff, and now had to spend yet another week living the same way.

"It was hard freezing her expressions there. In the editing room, it looked very sharp and nice so I did it elsewhere in the film, but it can quickly get to be a habit. I stopped doing it after a few films. I stopped using it as a visual effect. Now I use freeze frames only for dramatic effect. They're interesting providing viewers don't notice. You sense them, but an image is only perceptible — it takes eight frames for a shot to register. Fewer than eight frames and it's virtually unreadable, unless it's a tight close-up."

I'm actually not as much a fan of Werther as I am of Manon, Thais or even Don Quixote, basically because it's less rapturously erotic than the former two, and not as pathos ridden as the latter, but it still hits the spot often and with force! Dramatically, this production didn't convince, but I think the opera could work if it were more imaginatively directed, and had a far better actor as the lead. As it stood, it was an enjoyable evening, mainly for the music and visuals.

Brilliant. Utterly brilliant. Everyone embraced me and made me feel so comfortable. I wasn’t present for the table read, or any of the rehearsals – that was the original actor – so it must have been amazingly stressful for Hanna and Billie not knowing who they were acting opposite until the cameras started rolling. But they were very lovely and generous in what was an unusual situation.

The trading platform is simply the software in which you execute the trades from the front end. Metatrader and Oanda are two such platforms. I use Metatrader. However, the two are linked, because the broker, I believe, ultimately determines which platform you will use. It is possible some brokers allow use of both, but I haven’t looked into that.
When the anesthesiologist came back to get Lily, she just went right to her, no tears, no drama, just stuck her thumb in her mouth and put her arm around her neck and stared into her face like "who is this nice lady coming to get me?".

I wondered why my friend was not supposed to let on about being a judge? I'd think that must be counterproductive, since it makes it much harder for musicians with no real knowledge of the folk scene to get their stuff heard by people with influence. And this in turn would create a bit of a ghetto-ish vibe.
Fast forward a few years to the current year. Melissa’s fiancé had just received a new job but it meant that the two would have to move back to her home town. She didn’t mind though, her family lived there. She hadn’t seen her own family in so long.
The ambiguity surrounding some Islamist powers involved in Middle East revolts raise questions in the West about the trajectory in which ongoing turmoil is taking the region. Skepticism is exacerbated by the fact that some Al-Qaeda affiliates are enthusiastically talking about the opportunities that change in the Middle East holds for them. Lessons learned from Iraq’s transformation suggest two things; that the emergence of even a stumbling democracy makes extremists more vulnerable to change themselves, and that the potential for evolution towards democracy is greater than that for relapse towards theocracy. The international community should therefore remain engaged until that outcome is achieved.
Then you mention that of all your kids, your eldest child was the one who received several of her baby shots. Lets’s face it, you realise because she is your first child, you didn’t know what was going on back then and you followed everyone’s bad advise blindly. You gave her those shots because you just did not know any better. The drug companies and quacks capitalize on your ignorance. Please let THAT sink in. Nodding her head, Doc dives back into her books. Next you hear the most troubling news. There are 5 diseases which have plagued humans since time began. She names them: Leprosy, TB, syphilis, gonorrhea, cancer and………. By then you stop listening because your mind is racing, connecting all of the dots and now everything you ever suspected is confirmed as truth. These diseases can be traced back to ancestral family lines and a family can be predisposed to one of those diseases because of an ancestor who had the disease and that’s how diseases become hereditary. She mentions that the disease gets activated in a person through trauma or get ready, drum roll please….VACCINES! You are dumb founded and relieved to finally be getting some answers.

So, Malchezaar had Gorehowl, right? And at some point some Horde adventurers went in there and handed him his ass, and got Gorehowl from his body, and somehow or other it found its way back to Thrall, who gave it to me. So far so good. But every so often, the freaky bizarro zone up there kicks in, and sets off some kind of a time loop. So all of a sudden, Mechazzar is up and kicking again, and he’s got Gorehowl back on him, and what do you know, poof, wherever Gorehowl WAS, it’s not there anymore. Because it got time-loop-reset back up to Prince Fancypants up there in Karazhan.

A few weeks ago Wes at Amanti Vino convinced me to pick up a bottle of Echeverria Late Harvest Sauvignon Blanc, 2007. He knows I love a good dessert wine and assured me this was worthwhile. Not only was the bottle sold in an elegant tube package, but at $19.99, what did I have to lose? And as I was walking out the door to the birthday party, I remembered the bottle and threw it in my cooler bag (along with my fruit salad and sparkling water - I'm not completely blinded by my wine-colored glasses).
He heard something stir from behind him, from the other side of his open screen door. Something in his house had moved—a peculiar occurrence, being that he lived alone. But things had been moving by themselves within his house a lot over the past few weeks. There had also been voices, groaning whispers that he couldn’t understand.

The composition of the trunk varied in density and uniformity. As I studied the trunk my attention was that of fingering a button on my shirt or scratching at my side. In this world of edgeless blurred vibration, I could not tell what part of the tree trunk was the tree and what part was me. Don’t ask me how or why this was the case. It just was.
Welp, it's been quite a while since I posted on this blog so here I am. The holidays went smooth, I gained a pound. Since then I've made it to the gym several times and I am back down to 166.

But even with this, I find myself unable to come to terms with my dilemmas on personal religious doctrine combined with the doctrine the rest of the world accepts and adores. Growing up in a church that did not value an educational and intellectual approach to religion, as well as being constantly surrounded by people who blindly follow a belief structure simply because they were raised that way has become a demonizing part of my struggles with religion, as well as believing in God in general.

The alien Slithergees are a marvellous creation, constantly heaping self-pity on the humans and using manipulation to dominate. It is hilarious how often the Slithergee leader utters the pathetic line "I am a poor, blind Slithergee." It is unusual for a Seventh Doctor story to go right-wing and attack politically-correct values. This story is clearly hitting out at lobbies that defend the rights of the disabled and ethnic minorities (not necessarily a line I would want to take, though I am a Tory). Seventh Doctor stories have tended to be far more left-liberal than this.

Within every lifetime, there are moments that can pretty much rock someone to the core. Even if it doesn't fully involve you, you still can get caught up in the event just as much as the true party involved. Sometimes you can see it coming but most of the time you don't. Some can handle surprises like these, but unfortunately I am not one of those kinds of people. I take mine like a sucker punch to the face. And the best example if this comes from last Thursday night when I had one hell of a bomb shell dropped on me.
Kicking the night off with a new track, “White Noise,” Mogwai followed with the sublime “Friend of the Night,” off Mr. Beast, the stage lighting inducing flashbacks of the track’s insanely popular YouTube video with that spotlight which follows a never-ending path of eerie plaster carvings. Though definitely heavy on new tunes like “Rano Pano,” “How to Be a Werewolf” and “You’re Lionel Richie,” the setlist included a few surprises, like 1997 single “New Paths to Helicon, Pt. 1″ and “Batcat” from the 2008 EP of the same name, bringing out audience favorite “Mogwai Fear Satan” from 1997′s Young Team for the final encore. Mogwai returns Stateside in September but will only hit up the east coast. Road trip, anyone?

It’s not that the legislature can’t do anything about it, it is clear that they have no intention of doing anything at all. They have no desire to debate the manufactured “science” cited as the reason for necessity of the law, nor to question the mercantile motivation of the Smoking Ban sponsors. Legislators know full well that Smoking Bans are designed to drive pharmaceutical company profit by rescinding business property rights, and eliminating the venues available to adults that choose to smoke. It is government approved coercion to use the NRT products marketed by Smoking Ban sponsors while still keeping tobacco sales legal.

Aw, gee. A 7… but let me explain. Gone, for the most part, are the traits that made the characters in the the first book seem like clones of those other, more sparkly, immortals. Gone is the angst and uncertainly that drove me mad about Kate in the first book. But unfortunately, gone is Vincent for a large part of Until I Die. And he is sorely missed. I clung to the moments where he and Kate were together; for in these moments, Vincent was a charmingly swoon-worthy, if not “under the weather”, immortal. I loved how their relationship was dealt with in this installment, although I still wonder why they insist of “keeping secrets” in order to “protect” each other… In addition, I love the way that Amy pulled Kate’s grandparents even further into the story and into Kate’s life. What I didn’t love was the inclusion of some new, rather predictable, new characters. The lack of Vincent and the inclusion of these new characters were what dragged the Characters score down.

Assistant taps into many aspects of the iPhone, according to people familiar with the feature and SDK findings. For example, one can say make appointment with Mark Gurman for 7:30 PM and Assistant will create the appointment in the user’s calendar. On noting events, Assistant also allows users to set reminders for the iOS 5 Reminders application. For example, a user could say “remind me to buy milk when I arrive at the market.” Another example would be integration with the iOS Maps application. A user could ask: “how do I get to Staples Center?” and Assistant will use the user’s current location via GPS and provide directions.

But in the late 1970s Top of the Pops began allowing limited numbers of pre-recorded music videos. This is another symptom of the larger shift in the nature of television away from the BBC’s theatrical model and towards a different model. Increasingly the video clip became recognized as an existent item. This has been manifesting across the board - in the increasing realization that junking the BBC archives was a mistake, in the shift towards a more heavily edited style for Doctor Who, and in how music is performed.

Austin had an appointment with his nephrologist today. That’s the kidney doctor for those of you not in the know. While we don’t have any official results from his labs yet, she did say that his estimated GFR is now about 60. If you remember back to last spring when we were trying to decide whether or not to continue chemo, our dilemma was driven in large part by an abysmal GFR of 27. Anything below 30 makes a patient eligible for dialysis and a GFR below 15 indicates that it’s time for transplant.
Dr. Burke then shows Helen a security tape, showing the night she was admitted to the psych ward. When they get to the part where Candyman was floating above Helen, she can clearly see that there was nothing above her. She watches the tape in disbelief.
We got our results yesterday. Our appointment was at 1:15 but we weren’t seen until 1:45 because people are inconsiderate and run late for their appointments.

This is Mr. Sunny. 10 years ago I adopted Mr. Sunny and Miss Abbey together, when I was returning from a trip to N. Carolina. He has always been such a quiet fellow that I hardly knew he was in the house. He seems to have very few social skills, always sitting a little way off watching what is happening but rarely taking part in whatever is going on.
Jesus didn’t let His disciples ‘help’ Him when the Roman soldiers came for Him. He kept them out of it, or, in a manner, left them behind; Then Abraham said to his young men, “Stay here with the donkey;
Here’s a poem I wrote when I was 20 years old. It expresses my hunger for life and excitement for what lay ahead of me. It also reveals an insatiable restlessness developed through years of being a shut-in (I can’t think of more than one close friend I’ve made in college; that’s how serious I was about getting the hell out). The title of the poem doesn’t mean I was afraid of heading forward; walking sideways means living in the moment while keeping your goals in sight.
It's a question of taking the idea that formal schooling isn't the only way, all the way. Idzie says she doesn't want a "normal" job. The jobs she aspires to are occupations that don't need school; (she's already a very successful writer and has already been invited to speak at alternative education conferences!). Her job interests include natural medicine consultant, writer/editor, vegetarian/vegan cooking/catering, teaching primitive skills... which can be learned through apprenticeships.

She also recalled the grind of playing vaudeville in her native Brooklyn. “I was doing so many shows that I was losing two pounds a day. It was a matter of life and death! There wasn’t much relaxation. You didn’t even have time to eat. When you start in the morning and work until midnight – it gets to where you don’t have any personal life. You just exist!”
Well Mr Johnson is Lichfield’s favourite son; his birthplace is a museum; there’s a plaque on the site where he was first taught English in primary school; and his statue and portrait is to be seen all over the place. What surprised me, given his propensity to come up with pithy lines, including on coffee and tea, was that there was no sign of these quotes on the walls of the tea rooms and coffee shops we visited yesterday.

Encounter: 4 Songhaunts, 1 Spectral Bard
The next day I met up with Nik who is a friend of a friend of a friend of a blah blah blah, who just moved to Tokyo. We decided to explore the city together. (Read: explore; wander around all night waiting for the fish market to open at 5am) At the crack of dawn we ditched the Ramen shop we were hanging out and and made the trek to Tsukiji Fish Market. Upon arrival we wasted no time ordering up a Sake and a full spread of the worlds freshest sushi. (Tip: It never hurts to make friends with the chef.) As we watched the chef carefully construct our amazing breakfast, I had to stop myself from drooling all over the bar. After what seemed like an eternity (Real Time: 8 minutes) an incredibly beautiful plate of food was placed in front of me. I expected myself to inhale this masterpiece in seconds but found myself hesitating to even pick up my chopsticks. Why you ask? The answer is this. I love sushi. I love sushi at home. It’s delicious and I eat it all the time. If I eat this magical plate of food will I be ruining sushi for me forever? Will I ever be able to eat the sushi back home again? This hesitation lasted approximately 36 seconds, when I turned to Nik and noticed the look of pure bliss on his face as he ate a piece of fatty tuna belly. Let me tell you this, NO REGRETS. We ate slowly and allowed ourselves to enjoy every last bite, sipping sake along the way. Definitely a food highlight in my life.
Also: the flavor of this salad really deepens with time, so consider making it a day (or even two) before you want to eat it.
One package that fell more under the former than the latter category was from a 'promotions' company trying to convince us that we should commission them to make us some Sell! Sell! branded pens. They even sent an example to whet our appetite. That pen is the pen you see above.

Traces of earthly remnants cling to the inside of the bottle, serving as a reminder of its century long hideaway within the depths of the sea.

I was using an Eagle Industries external medical pouch from my medic ruck for my IFAK/BOK, but it was too big and got in the way whenever I dove to the ground. I switched it out for a single-stack rifle magazine pouch instead. It holds a large Israeli Battle Dressing, a Nasopharyngeal Airway device, a chest punch needle and chest seal (needle thoracostomy, for reduction of pneumothorax issues), and a pair of nitrile gloves. It wouldn't hurt my feelings to add a package of compressed gauze, but I'm not overly concerned about lacking it either. This set-up provides me with enough gear to provide basic self-aid for most battlefield injuries that I'm likely to sustain and still be able to treat (to reiterate, since the question came up in a class/clinic recently, your IFAK/BOK is there to treat YOU. It's NOT for your buddy. If he doesn't have one, make him build one, build one for him, or improvise when the time comes to patch holes in him. DO NOT USE YOUR PERSONAL IFAK/BOK to treat ANYONE else. In addition to her personal IFAK/BOK, HH6 even had me mount on on the morale officer's diaper bag!)
Initially, I wasn't going to include Live in London in my coverage of the Judas Priest discography, because, frankly, I couldn't be bothered to track it down and add it to my collection after being underwhelmed by the very similar '98 Live Meltdown. But, thankfully I've got friends who are far more thorough and obsessive than I am over particular bands, and as it turns out, Live in London is actually a step better than its predecessor in terms of delivering a more memorable performance from the newer singer. Not so much that I would plunk my money down to find a copy, but enough that I could recommend it over Meltdown to anyone seeking out it's probably the definitive 'Ripper' Owens Priest experience without actually being there in person.
We are not reloading; we are in a rebuilding process. Our team is made up of reserves of past years and freshmen who will get the opportunity to play this year and hopefully be up to the challenge…Our baseball accomplishments measured by victories this year could be moderate. From our players we need a dedication of purpose, firm self-discipline and tenacious determination. Hard work and aggressive play must overcome our limitations.
Quirks and Adjustments... I had to lengthen the bodice in front by 1". I did this above the dart if I remember right, then I did the same for the side pattern piece at the same level. I added that 1" to the side seam in back, but tapered to nothing at the CB piece, since I normally do a swayback type adjustment. I also had to shorten the stripes by 1-1/4". I think I could have shortened them a bit more...that might have solved my back bra-showage issue.

The funny thing is as you can imagine the kids haven’t seen each other for the summer, the parents haven’t seen each other.

This is a long overdue post, though not without reason. I got these lip tars back in August but only got to make this mixing post now because the colors are SO HARD to photograph!! I really don't understand why, I suppose the colors are too intense for my digicam? I'm no profressional photographer so I couldn't figure out why I couldn't get accurate photos of the color. At first I thought it was because of the dark/cloudy August and September weather so I was waiting for the weather to clear up so I could take photos in bright and natural lighting. Come the end of October, the weather is finally sunnier, but I still couldn't take proper photos. Anyway I decided to just post this and compensate by adjusting the colors through Photoshop, haha.
But the truth is that the food that our kids eat does have a direct effect on how they learn. That’s just the truth. So this isn’t a luxury. This isn’t a set-aside. This isn’t a sidebar. One recent study showed that kids who ate breakfast were more attentive. They had faster response times than kids who don’t. That’s learning.

We waited until the afternoon to decide if we wanted to get going with the labour. Dr. Sasha came in and talked to me about what he thought was the best idea and we decided to augment my labour and meet this baby. I was scared, I just wanted her to be okay. I knew she was going to be smaller and because she was under 36 weeks she would need to be admitted to the NICU. I asked who was working in the NICU that day it was Louise. Louise was also there for us with Jackson so it was like another bonus, I knew my baby girl was going to be in good hands.

Sure, The Wrong Man builds an almost unbearable amount of suspense, but in a very different way from many of Hitchcock's other works. This time around, the director tells the real-life story of Manny Ballestrero, a Stork Club musician and mild-mannered family man mistakenly sent to prison for a crime he didn't commit. The majority of the powerful tension created here derives from the fact that we know Ballestrero is innocent, and are powerless to do anything but watch as he gets trapped tighter and tighter in a net of bad luck and circumstantial evidence.

Only four of eleven fights went to a decision, which is more indicative of the experience range in fighters than overall how exciting it was. I can’t get over the fact that Liz Carmouche fought a girl with only one professional fight, that should have never been put together by the promotion or accepted by the commission. This fight alone devalued most of the card for me showing the need for better match makers.

But, then I heard the first single off the new album (“Strange Clouds”), and it made me start to think even more… It was one of those songs where I didn’t hate it, but I didn’t like it either… So I was stuck midway. After hearing “So Good” I started to learn towards the album being a positive release… Let’s see if I’m right…

And then there's Polanski. The director ensures a dialogue heavy and complicated script holds together without an ounce of fat. He apparently eliminated a Gittes voiceover from the script and tightened up the famous ending: bringing everything to a head in one climactic confrontation instead of over several more complex scenes. He also placed the film's celebrated "Forget it Jake, it's Chinatown" at the very end. The line had apparently already existed elsewhere in the script but Towne could never quite make it fit - in the end its placement is perfect, capturing the tragic futility Gittes struggle in a single phrase.

Whenever I hear people saying things like "Unschooling obviously wouldn't work for everyone, but parents should have a right to choose what's best for their kids," or one of the hundred other variants on that same sentiment, I always feeling a niggling sense of unease. It's never a statement I've agreed with. But until recently, I wasn't entirely sure why it bothered me! I mean, there's the obvious in that I believe unschooling can work for anyone, as unschooling is really free choice in education, so a child could choose something very structured, like their parent teaching them with a curriculum or going to school. But there was something more than that bothering me, and I only realized yesterday what it was.

But yet, while all the others were granted supervision and immediately released, I was issued the order to undergo compulsory treatment and rehabilitation for two years at a Pusat Serenti! I was shocked by `the injustice’ of it all: How could this be?! How could God have granted the others their immediate freedom while I – `the most deserving’ – have to undergo more of this ordeal?!

And I have no problem with the cheesiness of this film. It can be cheddar for all I care, this movie appeals to the child’s audience and the child in all of us.

Rule #9: While I personally enjoy my Summers off from work (now), I have also worked multiple jobs at a time just to keep up with my lifestyle. My normal work week is pretty much 24/7… I work very hard during the school year and then I enjoy my “time off” in the summers – yet I am always working. My goal is to create employment for myself where I am the master of my time – we’ll see if that comes to fruition (see Life List).
I hate PTSD. I hate that it took him. I hate that I forgot to tread lightly and look for the tell-tale signs that his mood was not matched with mine. I hate that he knows I wasn’t being a bitch but he can’t help himself and I hate that he is still intentionally hurting me with the word “whore”. I hate the war. I hate “I dunno”. I hate that he hates me but can’t live without me. I hate that he doesn’t know if he wants me to stay or go. I hate that I am settling for being hated. I hate that I don’t know if I’m even allowed to feel any of this and maybe I shouldn’t because most people actually have to live in the same space as it. I hate that I feel like a phony. And I hate that I feel useless.

But not everywhere is suffering equally. We are noticing that where there is a very pleasant village-style environment – where people in their leisure time will wonder around with a coffee with their kids, popping in and out of shops, getting fantastic service, having a little chat with the staff who they know quite well – these places are prospering. This is the reality of shopping: if it’s not a pleasant experience, why would you go out and do it? You will just buy those things online.

Having featured this lovely venue, I’d like to add what today’s secret actually is. When selecting a venue for your wedding, look past all the well-known venues that need to be booked two years in advance. Because these venues host so many weddings (sometimes up to 5 a week) – there’s a certain lack of intimacy and personalized service.

Our experience with the Japanese during the war was also a shared experience. Both city’s were ravaged by the cruel occupation. One could find very beautiful memorials dedicated to the heroes and victims of the war around downtown. The strategical location of Manila and Singapur were ideal for just about everything, including serving as military bases for invading armies. I’m hoping to find a good book about WWII events here in Singapore.

Well Corbet, I take strong offense to those comments!

Though the recipes are not low-fat, low-calorie or low-carb, it is because they aren’t meant to be. This isn’t a healthy eating cookbook by any definition (though many of its recipes can easily be adapted to be healthier); instead, it does what it set out to do: offer up many, easy-to-do “Mom Approved, Kid Tested” recipes.

That was it. We called the Bettles air from my finely working Iridium satellite phone to pick us up, packed, and were ready to go. We should return to this van – our only link to civilization in 12 days or so. That is assuming the weather cooperates. So far it was raining, all the time, just a bit harder or softer. The thinking was that pilots don’t fly late in the day (after 5PM) so we may end up camping on this lake (not so bad, there was a parking lot and a toilet not far from our van). But suddenly they decided that the weather was fine to fly (cloud level wasn’t very low so that they can see the mountains) and it wasn’t so late and sent two planes at the same time.

If the licensee fails to make a payment when due, the licence agreement generally provides for interest payments, at a specified rate and in the agreed-on currency.

Over Christmas break, Cathy and I were able to sneak away to the Winking Lizard and grab a beer in between last minute shopping, eating, and family time. I was able to finally get a chance to drink the Winter seasonal from Dogfish Head, Chicory Stout.

The series continued into the 1980s, but with the advent of new styles of animation, the Super Friends faded from Saturday mornings to go after prime time and the big screen.
Well we finally have the time to close out our blog. The internet wasn't working the last two nights in Almaty so we never got to update anything. Then getting home with two boys that didn't speak English gave us no time for anything. We finally have a moment for a breather and want to close out our blog. Here's a recap of the final days and an update on how we are doing.
What do you think?? Now, don't forget that you have to copy and paste the linky thing at the bottom of your Technique Challenge project. It is very easy. Just go to the Blockheads web page Tutorial and copy the HTML and paste it onto the bottom of your post. There are prizes and lots of fun. If you are a big Facebook person, you can enter on the Blockheads' Facebook page too. There is an additional prize over on Facebook. So have fun and let's see your creation!!
My mom is basically the same. The good thing is there is nothing medically wrong with her, other then her confusion at times.
Marlene: Leaving aside reading other writers, are there things that inspire you?
So stay with me, because we're throwing off the bowlines, sailing away from the safe harbor, catching the wind in our sails, and venturing off to explore, dream and discover the Truth.
Maybe Amanda will have another surprise for me!
Reed & Barton manufactures crystal patterns that are similar to more expensive brands. Their Richmond pattern retails for approximately $27.50 a stem, so all four pieces, wine glass, wine goblet, iced beverage, and champagne flute would cost around $120.00 dollars. When compared to the cost of some of the Waterford patterns, the Reed & Barton option gives you two pieces for the price of one Waterford.
When comparing blogs, a main difference I see is posting length. Some of the bloggers create quite lengthy posts, namely In the Library with the Lead Pipe. This blog contains essay-length posts that are well-written and well-researched with proper citations. In the case of such lengthy posts, I can recognize the value of thoroughly exploring a subject. I found, however, that I never made it to the end of a post, no matter how interesting the subject was, because I was constantly interrupted. If I were to continue to follow this blog, I would have to make sure that I dedicated a interruption-free time slot to read it.
And, retro-chic that’s classy as opposed to the shoddy stab at the same genre by the designers of Team Sky’s dreadful 2010 outfit which, incidentally, hung alongside the Rapha jersey on the same clothing rail.
Joe leads Van to Dr. Alex Brandt, a rugged vet with floppy blond hair and winning smile. But just as things are starting to heat up, the newlyweds return from their honeymoon, forcing Van to decide just how much she’s willing to sacrifice in order to have everything she ever wanted. Warm and witty, poignant and funny, Stay marks the arrival of an irresistible new voice.
Accusing someone of adultery was a very tricky thing because catching someone in the act of adultery was almost impossible. One person perhaps could follow the wayward couple and hide in order to witness a very private and intimate act, but two or three persons? Very unlikely. Those were days without smart phones or digital cameras. What you saw you saw with your eyes and you told with your mouth and people could either believe you or not. You really didn’t have much more than your word.
My argument is that sometimes this view was wrong. Just because the polytheistic culture in which they lived saw gods as violent brutes who waged war on humanity did not mean Yahweh ordered the slaughter of all men, women and children in the cities he wanted Israel to conquer. Just because the political class of Jerusalem wanted all citizens to centralize their worship, and therefore their commerce and taxes, within the city did not mean Yahweh was inaccessible outside its walls. Just because the monarchy was unable to stop the Assyrians and Babylonians from overrunning Samaria and Jerusalem did not mean Yahweh had failed, and it did not require the creation of a sin-judgment motif from which to explain their suffering.
As members of Amnesty International Geneva,Switzerland, we are dismayed by the detainment of the Tamil Naduu nuclear plant protesters, the charges of sedition, conspiracy and rioting lodged against many of them, and by the prospect that some of these protesters continue to remain in jail.

Indeed. You mentioned this idea of playscapes. How do you see this idea in relation to our consumption society? Is it a kind of liberation from the money economy, or are new ideas destined to become valuable marketable goods?

Regardless, I am still recommending this one, though perhaps not as strongly as I have recommended others in the past. I thought it was a great way to pass the time without getting bogged down in boring details or getting depressed like I have with some books. Let me know if you feel the same after you read it.
An infusion of the leaf, stems, and flowers will speed the healing of rashes, hemorrhoids, and skin ulcers. Dried and powdered yarrow sprinkled on cuts and abrasions may also facilitate healing. Native Americans used yarrow in poultice form to treat skin problems. Infusions of yarrow have been used as a hair rinse in attempts to prevent baldness.

I'm off to have a little tidy up and then I might do a spot of colouring. Before I go, I made top 3 at Pollycraft - water, water everywhere challenge. Thank You again to the lovely DT, I'm chuffed to bits.

Obviously, it's of utmost important that I look picture perfect on this trip, for...well, pictures. Duh.
Grandma, what’s wrong?
Not to put too fine a point on it. The book selling market in the UK is between a rock and a hard place. Booksellers in trouble. Publishers selling half the books sold at high discount levels, etc. Consequently, UK publishers aren't buying that much. As of late, it's one of the hardest territories to sell into unless a title sold for a lot of moolah in the US.
I tried to watch two points at once, the counter top where the towel had been and the floor where the towel was now. Neither revealed a crawly creature. I even quickly eyeballed the air freshener to see if it was giving refuge to the enemy. Nothing there either, so I knew that he must still be lurking in the folds of the towel.

Fire the glass to slump and fire polish. Include an annealing ramp when firing. Again, the firing schedule (and the annealing time) will vary. Watch the glass to see when the pieces slump. We annealed the glass for over an hour. Allow the glass to cool to room temperature before removing the glass from the glass fusing kiln.
The more we can begin to appreciate and account for (a) the fact that a person’s bad (Top Real Estate in Rockford Illinois) behavior in one moment does not necessarily warrant writing them off as a numbskull, and (b) the actual situational factors at play that might be influencing decisions and behaviors, the more effective we can be at shaping those factors and, to be frank, getting what we want.
When I asked Beverly for her love advice for Simply Solo readers, she said you have to work on yourself first. “What I’ve found is that healthy people attract healthy people. I have been in therapy for many years and attracted a few unhealthy people in my life. It was because I had unresolved patterns and issues in my life that I blamed on the world. There are plenty of great guys out there that want to have a monogamous, loving relationship. It’s just that you have to make yourself healthy so you can attract that person.”
People everywhere are looking for dividing lines. A place to stake our claim and to say we are on one side of an issue or another (which in and of itself isn't always bad)...Looking for a way to throw a wall up between ourselves and others...Trying to cause division instead of love.Judging each other instead of loving.
This is the first day we've had enough snow around here for hubs to actually have to go out. Maybe just 2-3 inches, so nothing too bad, which is nice. We had SO much snow last year and it was always the horrible, deep, heavy kind. I really hope we don't get too much of that this year. But, just in case, the hubs took out a potential new employee to see if she has what it takes...
I giggle that Preston is at that "cool" age where he can't be seen where pig hats anymore... we don't let him get away with it though!
Notes: I beg everyone to be patient with the manga. It would have been much more intense if you read it when it was serializing, however, I guarantee you, this manga has many unexpected turns.
Too bad he didn't like the bars more because it would have been a healthier alternative.

I have to ask too...who made that gorgeous blanket in the background of the first video?
But alas, it was not. The real Magic Spell is the slightly lighter/greyer shade on the right. It didn't take long, however, and pretty soon I was ready to paint the bottom.
I'm afraid I've only managed to draw complete blanks about The Zippers, who would seem to be an all-female group from America with definite soul leanings. This was their only British single, but what a single it is - "My Sailor Boy" on the A-side is raw, ragged but decidedly Pop, and fizzes with energy and enthusiasm. With some records, false bonhomie creeps through the sterility of the slick production and multiple takes and ruins the potential energy of a track, but this genuinely sounds like unsuppressed gusto.
Synopsis: Light Yagami is an ace student with great prospects–and he’s bored out of his mind. But all that changes when he finds the Death Note, a notebook dropped by a rogue Shinigami death god. Any human whose name is written in the notebook dies, and now Light has vowed to use the power of the Death Note to rid the world of evil. But when criminals begin dropping dead, the authorities send the legendary detective L to track down the killer. With L hot on his heels, will Light lose sight of his noble goal . . .?
As The Low Anthem sing, “I’ve got the cure for the shape that you’re in,” I couldn’t help but think back to moments in my life where I’ve been on my way back to New York, typically by train, and met at the grandeur lacking Penn Station, typically by the girl in my life. And as much as I love to travel and as much I enjoy riding the rails, at the end of a trip, there is nothing better than stepping off the train, ascending the stairs, passing folks who are just beginning their voyages and finding the cure for being on the road and away from home.
I was very impressed with all the testing and the three people who checked me out. First I had the usual blood draw etc. Then a PA came in to ask questions and examined me. The more we talked we realized that we had known each other many years ago when she lived in Brockport. I know some of her family members and she knows our daughters, graduated the year before Steph. Small world. Finally, a nurse came in and gave me the scoop on what I need to do before I get to the hospital (and what I should bring...as in shorts and t-shirts). All were very professional and reassuring.

I read very little last year. I don't know why. Perhaps the addition of a screaming insomniac baby didn't help or maybe I wasted too much time blogging, but this year I will devote more time to reading and less to drinking wine and surfing the internet. I will never achieve Dovegreyreader's ability to read nine Dickens novels in one day whilst quilting and healing the sick at the same time, neither will I manage Scott Pack's 137 books in one year. I am a slow reader. But if I can manage a book every week or so, it will be an improvement on the pitiful handful that I read in 2006.
In my mind, we were working towards developing a service which would initially have been similar to what was produced not long afterwards in Ireland – the Irish Research eLibrary (IReL) – i.e. common and deep access to electronic resources from multiple sources including numerous bibliographic databases and other catalogues. This could then have developed further into, essentially, a ‘Summon for all’ type service for UK higher and further education institutions. i.e. instead of individual institutions spending £20k or £30k each per year (or whatever the figure is) on individual commercial web-scale discovery services, this could have been achieved nationally, with subject-based flavours.
Have a blessed Valentine’s Day,
Then I remembered an old trick unwed mothers used to use: they'd fake being married with a wedding band. I figured it might work on some of the guys, not all of them probably, but some of them. It might be like a bulb of garlic to vampires... well, to some vampires. Those middle aged couples I've seen hooking up: I'm pretty sure all parties involved were married, just not to each other.
Will you quit kicking me under the table?
Pube Nazi: LOL. I can't eat that much.
Not to be. James kicked off by reminiscing about the last time he was at The Courthouse and had to endure the double pain of being sat next to Shandy for the night AND having to drive an hour home and therefore unable to savour the joys of our extensive beer list. Tonight he was able to sip plenty of Samuel Smith’s Old Brewery Pale Ale with his beer battered fish supper & mushy peas.
Supergroup my ass. That term generally signifies bland half-baked jams (Superheavy, Them Crooked Vultures), main group throwaways (Golden Smog, Monsters of Folk), intriguing novelty (The Baseball Project, Tinted Windows) or sheer wretchedness (Chickenfoot). Middle Brother brings their A game and top flight songs.
I had literally just started thinking about what project we'd tackle when I walked outside and much to my surprise John and Reed had come up with an idea and nearly had it completed to boot! I didn't even know John knew about the project.
I still have a load of cassette tapes floating around (maybe 150 or so)... mainly obscure stuff that has not been released on CD or live bootlegs of shows...
The trilogy deals with three dominant aspects of the contemporary human condition, three aspects that are all well past their prime. They will be replaced by something else, the questions are: by what, when, and how. The answers proposed are not predictions, (I believe in free-will) they are proposals.
Our little girlie turned 16 in July! That morning we drove in to the DMV so she could take her road test and get her driver's license. After an initial setback: they wouldn't let her finish the test once it was discovered that my emergency break didn't work-WHO KNEW?!?-luckily another woman offered to let Dylan use her car. We sat on standby for 2 hours. Poor kid SO wanted to get that license on her birthday! We watched kid after kid come in from their tests in tears-the Anchorage testers are known for being VERY tough! She did great, though! Came back all smiles!
and I can now say that I know 'inglourious basterds' by heart.
I pulled an all-nighter just to watch this in one sitting.

As with other titles illustrated by Bruce Whatley close inspection of the pictures will provide many visual jokes as well.
To honor her, I tried my hand at making authentic Polish pierogies based on the recipe that she shared with me. Although not difficult, it was a labor of love. If you are not familiar with perogies it is a dumpling that can be filled with potatoes, meat or vegetables, that is then sauteed after being boiled. Periogies are a traditional food that are enjoyed in Eastern Europe and Russia.
Long story short, just don’t ever stop writing, be careful not to burn yourself out (I think that is what I may have done with NaNo), but don’t let yourself just stop either. It’s painful to come back to it, even though I love it, even though I keep trying…

I arrived in California on Friday, getting picked up by a most wonderful friend of my mother’s, Kathy. She and her husband were super awesome and took me for Chinese dinner, then a mini Game of Thrones marathon before dropping me off at kick off the next morning.

I don’t mind contributing that two per cent. I see it as my national obligation. But you refuse to pay up when you graduate from school someday in the future, and the PTPTN cannot just close shop this way. So, we taxpayers are once again come under the axe.

They have room for a very large dining table that will seat 10 and have 8 existing chairs in a woven seagrass. I would like my friends to choose 2 new dining chairs for either end of the table that will be real statement pieces so I have a collection of images to provoke ideas for them and getting them to think a little outside the square.

Belt fabric: I used fake leather, but you can use whatever you want! Make sure your fabric does not have any stretch and is sturdy enough to handle belt-stress (or else plan on interfacing that sucker!). I have 1/4 yard here, but I think you could feasibly get by on much less… 1/4 yard was just the minimum cut at my particular store.
This recipe makes a very rich and slightly bitter hot chocolate. Consume with moderation as it tends to cause excessive Christmas cheer. Enjoy!

Americans don't like soccer because nothing happens in soccer. "Well what about baseball?" you are probably whining right now, as your ilk often does. Baseball, while admittedly a more deliberate affair than basketball or football, is far and away more interesting than soccer. Baseball features fairly regular scoring, and a game that can change complexion with a single swing of the bat.
Found this video of Cyrus at the OCW Jummah Prayers Show (on the 21st) Cyrus starts the video and speaks til about 2:25 (he returns at 9:54) It is a very 'pretty ' video of "Jummah Day".

“I’d say about 90% certainty that they will,” Tanner replied. “The old man looked me in the eye when he told me they would. He didn’t blink or look away. He didn’t look angry or upset … just resigned to move on and try to find a new spot.”

Okay, maybe the real reason I’m nervous is because I keep thinking about my friend Marie, who was pregnant a few months ago. She went in to the clinic for her first pre-natal visit and they did some sort of blood tests on her and told her that her baby would be deformed and that she’d better terminate the pregnancy soon. I still don’t know exactly what sort of tests they’re doing now, but I’ve read that they’re super accurate and we’ve really come a long way in being able to diagnose abnormalities before the pregnancy starts making a real baby.

If you’ve read two or three of his books from the list these stories were taken from, then I think you’ll still enjoy it. I previously read five of the twelve books so the feeling of déjà vu popped up somewhat frequently for me which I found a tad disappointing.
“Frank’s not here yet, but if he was, that blueberry pie would be gone.” Because “was” is used, even if it read, “If Frank was here, that pie would be gone,” readers can assume that Frank will show up eventually, and the pie is in danger.

This bee preserved in amber is identical to present-day honeybees. These, with the same mechanisms they have possessed for millions of years, continue living in the same social structure. No “survival of the fittest” of the kind claimed by evolutionists is ever to be seen in beehives. On the contrary, bees behave with the highest levels of altruism and co-operation, in a beehive hierarchy consisting of the queen, workers and males (or drones).
Only to wake up to Noodle in the next room screaming, “MAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!” in the middle of the night.
The room was silent as he finished talking and after a pause he turned his attention to the young woman at his feet. It had been his intention to have her in the quarters that had been prepared for him, but after facing such resistance he felt the need for an audience. He grasped her by her throat and as he pulled her upright she struggled against him, yelping and moaning. He could barely contain himself. He dragged Jezebel to the nearest table (which was quickly vacated) and threw her open it, spilling its contents to the ground. In the corner her associates merely watched. They hadn’t moved at all. No matter. Lord Fuckington grabbed at her tits, squeezing them hard, and then ripped open her blouse, snapping the drawstring.
It was a whirlwind weekend and a great experience. I produced content for the Conference Daily printed newspaper (We handed our content to the printer at 7 p.m. and had fresh copies, hot of the press by 5 a.m. each morning) and for the conference blog. Below are a few of the stories I produced.

So, sorry about that long story, but I wanted to tell you guys about it. Thank you for your well wishes and you know what, we DID get home safe and for THAT we are truly grateful!
I will try to get the kitchen island wrapped up soon so I can take some pictures! I didn’t plan on this post being so long, but sometimes that just happens.
I was playing with the buttons on my blog (Don't worry. The vortex port in space-time is still closed) and found the method to show bloggers I follow.
I’ve gone on and on about acting but I’m going to go on a bit more. A month ago, we organized an acting workshop in the theatre group that I’m in. It was supposed to be about comedy but we concentrated more on bodylanguage, expression and how you can express something in a very small and delicate way or make it big and noticeable.
Evalle is partnered with the new guy, Storm, taking shifts with others of her clan (the Beladors) to search for the Ngak stone. The god Shiva has prophesied that it would find a powerful female and the apocalypse would begin. They have a week to find it, during which time, Evalle must solve a murder that would otherwise be pinned on her, and show the gods that she isn’t a dangerous creature that needs to be locked up, but a powerful ally that needs to remain where she is.

“2 Broke Chicks” (CBS) This show really bummed me out, man. I was so looking forward to it and really expecting a lot from the crackling-good cast, but, the writing was just not there to back them up. And on top of all that, the jokes were really gross. And not even clever gross, just gross and crass for crass-ness sake. Urgh…soooo disappointing!
She adjusted her top again, strode up to the door, and tugged it open, only to walk head on into a tall drink of bouncer. She tipped her head back and gasped. Wow, evil sure looked good these days. No wonder they did so well in there.
"Chief among the creatures who gather around Diana is vampire Matthew Clairmont, a geneticist with a passion for Darwin. Together, Diana and Matthew embark on a journey to understand the manuscript’s secrets. But the relationship that develops between the ages-old vampire and the spellbound witch threatens to unravel the fragile peace that has long existed between creatures and humans—and will certainly transform Diana’s world as well."
And this bonds us. Permanently.
There was more to come the next day in the news paper. I read a story that there had been an unsolved murder at Palaruvi waterfalls the week before. My goodness! The torn shirt piece I noticed at the water fall was probably torn off the victims body in a scuffle. Now a real eerie feeling set in.
“I didn’t say that. You two can be by-standers.”
I’d sleep for as long as I could and then I’d get up. I always slept for at least 6 or 7 hours but I always got up around 8pm at the latest to go back into work that night. I used to leave the house at about 8:30pm.
The goal is to let your doctor know that you value the good care she gives you. If your doctor goes the extra mile for you, express gratitude. We all like to hear that we have done well or that we have done something to improve someone else’s life. Doctors need that too.
I also have some other totally awesome news....... I've signed up to take another class with???? .......... Suzanne Dean.... Yeahhhhhhhhhh she is coming to one of my 'kind of' local craft stores. It's almost an hour away so when I take a trip there it's usually only once a month. I took a few of her Copic classes last year and what an awesome great time I had. She is so talented sweet and wicked funny.
JS: The hardest part was actually writing the book. That’s a lot of words to weave together in some form of coherency! As the ideas and plotlines swarm around the sieve that controls what flows out of your fingers, it can get difficult to filter which ideas are viable for any given story. The fact of the matter is that I enjoy writing; I enjoy the sense of satisfaction I receive when I finish a chapter or a story. Once the story is completely finished, and the editing starts, there’s almost a relaxation that occurs. You have the story that you wanted to write out of your head and your soul, now it’s just polishing it to the point that it’s the best that it can be. Teaming with my publisher, Sirens Call Publications, helped me to traverse the world of publishing as well. Was it a struggle at times? Absolutely, but in the end it was a labor of love and one that I will happily do over and over again…
And it's "all about the love"---as fits the date (it's still Valentine's Day here in California). Dave Hingsburger hosted the February edition, about loving the stuff that makes life work--accessibility symbols, service dogs, a power chair, big jackets with pockets...and then veers into ruminations on cyborgs, gratitude, and friendship. I love when a host highlights the connections between many diverse posts, and Dave certainly does that.

Boo! I've been a ghost lately but since it's Halloween I figured I should stop by and scare up some fun with these creepy cookies. These delectable digits may look ghastly, but they really are freakishly good! Go ahead and give your guests the finger this Halloween! You won't regret it! ; )
However, he noted that the B.C. Social Credit legacy keeps being reincarnated, under different banners. "Each transition gives the NDP a chance at power, which they manage to fail at," he notes.
For example if you question the unmitigated benefits of multiculturalism you are decried as a racist, if you suggest that any section of the community, other than the white community, might possibly have undesirable behavioural or social characteristics, you are a racist, in fact if you demonstrate anything short of total surrender to the cult of enrichment that in itself will automatically render one at risk of shrill accusations of bigotry, xenophobia, hatred, and of course racism.
None of this would happen with Dr. G. She would take great pains to pay attention to my every detail. She would inspect my bowel, “inch by inch” and I have no doubt she would keep her latte in the break room.
We, the purveyors of ghosties and other bad things that go bump in the night and scare the bejesus out of us, are starving. Fed a barely palatable diet of uninspired remakes of Japanese horror imports and 80s slasher flicks served up with paltry sides of three-dimensional gimmicks and computer-generated imagery for the past several years, and we’re malnourished. It’s no surprise then that we’re so hungry for quality, so ravenous for something to satiate our horror taste buds that we’d pounce like a slobbering alien on the crew of the Nostromo on the first promising morsel of original horror cinema that crosses the threshold of our local multiplex.

Any one who spent anytime as a youth during the 1980’s no matter what ages, has at some point felt a connection to a John Hughes film. One of the decades most loved film makers, Hughes passed away 2 1/2 years ago and had given up writing original screenplays, although he was the creator behind some movies with story ideas. He hadn’t directed a film since 1991’s Curly Sue. His films throughout the 80’s were loved by all and Hughes himself was regarded as a voice for the youth of all kinds. A voice for the youth wasn’t his only talent as a story teller.
But since Shyla's rescue, things have gotten bizarre. Or as the other paladins are used to saying: things have gone all to Zell. After returning from a mission in the Sierra Nevada broken and almost dead, Zell learns a new type of undead is stalking him.

Sax took his Buppy in with him for surgery, so Buppy got a new 'collar' for surgery (since the wrist band wouldn't fit his arm.) When the nurse took the IV out of Sax's hand, though, he didn't put pressure on the hole right away and blood gushed across Buppy's back. I got most of it cleaned up. Buppy is going to need a bath. But here is a picture of him and Buppy snuggling on the couch once we got home....

On this day: November 11th 1925; your forefather (Me Da) James Gilmour O'Brien was born in Brooklyn N.Y. and because it was Veterans Day he always had his Birthday off! This was pretty HUGE to me as you might expect 'cause without him there would be no me. No me; no you! :)
I am entering this in the following challenges...
Yay! The new sketch is up at the Freshly Made Sketches Blog, and I couldn't wait to play along. While I haven't yet posted them, I have been able to keep up with my goal of five Christmas cards a month for the 2012 Christmas Card Challenge at Splitcoast. But that is all I have done - my 5 a month, and that is NOT going to get me to the number of cards I will need for the holidays.
I grew up reading Thor comics, I have more than a passing knowledge of Norse mythology, and armed with these two things I still struggled through Thor, not only the worst movie I’ve seen in years, but easily the worst superhero movie ever made. Worse than Fantastic Four. Worse than Daredevil. Worse than Ghost Rider. Worse, in a way, than the Dolph Lundgren Punisher.
01. SO I CAN SPREAD THE WORD, duh! I’ve wanted to speak about recovery/eating disorders (or write or something..) for a long time. But I was so actively in my disorder (/or in denial) that I couldn’t do it. I mean, who would take me seriously first of all. And second of all, I really couldn’t live with myself if I was touting the awesomeness of recovery but going home and throwing away my dinner or something. But this has been a huge motivator for me. I love being able to share with others that this is POSSIBLE and sosososo much better than being sick. Even though it’s hard and messy and uncomfortable.
The recipes varied widely, some requiring lengthy baking times, others as simple as a skillet, pecans and honey. I thought I’d start out with a simple version – just honey and pecans in a skillet – but when I poured them onto a cookie sheet to cool, they stayed very sticky, as if they were coated in caramel.
Well, I think she missed the point of the piece, in which I argued that people “whom doctors used to call ‘mentally retarded’” and members of Mensa – incorrectly described routinely as “geniuses” – are both freaks by mathematical definition because they each make up less than 2% of the population.

I read more of Mary Oliver's work after we studied some of her poetry in my writing workshop this past fall. I've been thinking about this line, this question, this challenge lately.
The tower built therein is the word concerning God himself, and concerning Christ’s dispensations. This vineyard He committed to husbandmen, that is, to the people that was before us, both priests and laity, and went into a far country, by His departure giving opportunity to the husbandmen.

My teaching philosophy hinges on a set of values that have progressively clarified over the course of the past five years. As an educator, what I value most are: 1. The importance of critical-historical thinking; 2. The importance of collateral learning; 3. The importance of openness in educational resources; 4. The importance of empathy to understanding the past; and, 5. The importance of a Do-It-Yourself attitude for the cultivation of life-long learning.

. . . he is discovering all the not-so-fun things about being a toddler boy. hitting, pinching, biting, slapping. poor sydney is usually the victim of these attacks. her long hair is constantly getting yanked. she sweetly gives him a hug and he tries to bite her shoulders. mommy frequently gets slapped or clawed in the face. this is all new for us. i've broken back out the "what to expects" and "happiest child on the block" to figure out how to solve these issues. i know it's no big deal. i know it's normal. i know it's just a phase. but still, being backhanded by your toddler really hurts . . . especially a toddler who doesn't really "get" the concept of time-out yet.
Teens may not listen to authority figures, but they do listen to each other. Firsthand stories of the constant fear, danger and violence of life inside a gang are a way to reach young people on the cusp of making the life-destroying decision to join a gang. Quotes from the interviewed gang members will be included in ARISE Foundation’s new upcoming collection of stories about gangs, written by people from all over the country. Each story was handpicked to illustrate a critical point. Topics range from the disastrous effects gang life has on someone’s family members to how easy it is to lose your life to gang violence. The stories illustrate, using plaintive, stark language, how easy it is to get caught up in the endless cycle of revenge that gang members live in every day.

Note: If you want to read the Iliad, I recommend the translation of Richmond Lattimore. It’s available both as a printed book and as an eBook. I am including the publisher’s link which provides purchasing options here. Lattimore is also available free online through Northwestern University’s Homer Project. This is great but you’ll have to cope with the English being interspersed with the original ancient Greek – it’s great if you’re a Classics student!

Some people think married couples wear wedding rings to show our status, like a cab driver with a rooftop sign alit: “Unavailable.” For me, it’s a reminder and a connection. I look down at that ring and feel not just the love for my husband, but all of our history – beautiful and challenging alike – as well as the place where we fell in love and said our vows. I love that place.
Unfortunately, the analysis does not end there. I’ve been to university. I’ve studied English literature and teaching at three of Europe’s most prestigious institutions. I’ve never even held a real gun, let alone used it to pistol-whip anyone. And do I try hard? Yes, I do try hard. There’s no doubt about it: I’m a David, caught in a web of sterile self-reflection. I wouldn’t know an engaging story if it came along and shat in my mental toilet.
Most agree that Clausen’s early commitment was precipitated by the imprisonment and subsequent transportation to Tatooine of Carroll. Though reports are hazy at the moment, insiders have speculated that Carroll was lured into a trap by Sith lord and ICAA President Darth Brand in an alliance of convenience with Notre Dame and the Hutt syndicate. The resulting battle has accounted for at least four dozen Rebel Alliance casualties and an unknown number of USC football team manager deaths.

I pick up pennies. My grandfather, a man who holds a large part of my heart so tenderly, once told me his grandmother, the woman who raised him during The Great Depression, always walked with her head down searching for stray coins. I found this so touching; I never walk by any coin without picking it up but see people do that quite often. The first time I visited her grave, I placed a penny upon it and said, “Thank you for raising my Granddad” and wept for a while never to know the woman who meant so much to him. Piper’s middle name is my great, great grandmother’s maiden name. Maybe I should invent yoga pose, “Penny Picker.” Regardless, you see the irony, not pick up a penny or coin but complain when a few are added to the cost of a stamp, often a work of art in itself.
Spending the time to repair the walls was well worth it, however, because as soon as the first coat of paint went up, I could see the improvement.

Here’s the bad part about affairs – in the end, there is a very high risk that you won’t end up with the woman/man and someone ends up getting hurt, and in my situation, someone did get hurt, and that person was me. My friend from the forum asked me, “If he ever realized how much you were hurt and wanted to try to make it up to you, is there anything he could do to make it up – you know, make up for the pain?” That was a deep question. I am over that situation, but emotional pain is not something easily erased. It’s not as simple as saying you’re sorry- some cases of “making it up” require action(s) and not words, and this is exactly what my old friend meant. I don’t have an answer for her – I told her that I’ll have to think about that and email her in one day or so. If I come up with an answer, I’ll let you all know, too. And, who knows, maybe he also was hurt in the end – I hope not, I made sure to give him lots of love and an exorbitant amount of good sex whenever we could have it! Lol. If I did hurt him, he doesn’t seem to be the kind of man that you could make that up to, even if you wanted to. With that said, I will not say, “I’ll never be involved in an affair again” because I might shoot myself in the foot; after my experience, I know better to never say “never”. I won’t go out of my way to be in one, but if I DO find myself in such a situation, I WILL NOT be getting hurt because I won’t be taking him seriously, I will definitely date other men, and….you can do like Annie and “bet your bottom dollar” that Sam will be compartmentalizing like a m*tha-f*cka!
What are you doing right now while trying to write this post??? Watching NCIS reruns.
I can't recall where this one was recorded. There are only two songs on the actual studio part of the demo, but one is 6 mins, and the other is a fucking 8 minute long epic. I have no idea what we were thinking in writing songs that long, but here they are. The other three songs on the tape are live at the Shaker high school battle of the bands. The sound quality is pretty good. I think we won.. I forget, I got kicked out of the school before we were done playing.

Findings of the research will be published in summer 2012, for more information please view the press release.
Whilst I was waiting for ECG and bloods the receptionist came to find me to check whether I am attending both of the hospital appointments I'm scheduled for on thursday afternoon. After confirming that yes I am, yes they are both at different hospitals and yes I had tried to change the date we got to the point which was how to transport my notes between the two sites when the appointments are only 2 hours apart. I suggested that perhaps I could take the notes with me when being driven from the first to second appointment but that is not allowed as I am a patient. I might after all eat my notes for something to do in the car. Or read them. The possibilities of what I could do with a pile of notes entirely about myself, weighing almost as much as myself are frankly endless. So instead a nice man with a van will have to drive from one hospital to the other to collect the notes and we'll all hope they turn up at either or both consultants appointments...cos to be fair to the doctors, running a consultation without any notes is a bit tricky. Not to mention potentially wasteful of money or any such practical considerations.

I wasn’t really expecting to learn as much an insight and moral from an action-packed movie – especially a superhero movie – such as The Avengers. Maybe I wasn’t into critiquing the plot of a movie or maybe I was boxed with the idea that movies do not necessarily reflect reality. But I sure did pick up lessons after I’ve seen the film.

I can finally, just now, start to think about Mila's future a bit more. Seriously during that time we had to literally take life one moment at a time and simply could not see past the stepping stone we were currently walking on. Looking back I picture Shawn and I standing in the middle of an empty land with stepping stones only behind us, trying to see ahead but not being able to because of the heavy fog. Moment by moment, the Lord reached out and took our hands leading us to the next stone. The night I was alone in CICU with Mila I was soooo tired and stressed after a long rough day. She woke up for the 78th time and I just stood by her bed praying for God to lay His hand on her and comfort her because I was too weary to keep at it by myself. At that moment I so vividly felt God's hand on my shoulder comforting me. I prayed for Him to comfort her not me. But there He was beside me when I felt I couldn't carry on another minute alone. I surely felt His presence at that time more than any other time I can remember. Peace washed over me and I could feel so many prayers being said for Mila and for us. I treasure that memory because it comes to mind each time I am weary and feel like I can't make it to the next moment and it reminds me He is our strength and with Him we can get through anything even when the moment seems absolutely impossible. Mila-bean is teaching me so much already and helping me find a strength I never knew I could tap into.

Antichrist follows the story of She (Charlotte Gainsbourg) and He (Willem Dafoe) a couple who, after the death of their toddler son, go to their cabin in the woods Eden (natch) where the man experiences increasingly bizarre visions and she exhibits increasingly violent sexual behavior. He finds She's work that she did for her PhD which is about witchcraft and the writing gets more obsessive and insane. She maims He brutally by smashing his testicles and drilling a hole through his leg and bolting a stone through it.

There, in the middle of the store, she was putting her flip-flops back on under the judging eye of a mother, who for good reason, did not want her daughter walking barefoot through a department store! Can you blame her? And what of the daughter who slips shoes off so easily with no thought of the pathogens lining the floor? The daughter reminded me of me. You couldn’t keep shoes on me when I was a kid. My feet were tough as little hooves from walking to friends houses barefoot; from running in warm summer rain. Barefoot was the sensuous and free delight of childhood.

Up in the Air is brutally raw. It is embedded with irony and colorful imagery that leads the reader to get lost in the story as it becomes more twisted, more apparent that something is not right. As we turn the pages we are left in wonderment of a life we will never live, yet can completely relate to. It offers a refreshingly real and honest look at the deformities of human nature as Bingham grows more and more paranoid and self-indulged the closer he gets to his goals, leaving us with one question – what really matters in life?

The Shard, also known as the Shard London Bridge, is a glass (recalling a shard of glass) pyramid-shaped skyscraper under construction in Southwark, London. The structure was just recently completed in April 2012, and it is expected to open to the public quite soon. The structure has been designed with an irregular triangular shape from the base to the top and through a sophisticated use of glazing with expressive façades of angled glass panes intended to reflect sunlight and the sky above, so that the appearance of the building will change according to the weather and seasons.

I cannot say it enough how happy I am about how this came together! I started by making the pinwheels. The larger pinwheel is made from a 3'' square and the smaller pinwheels are from 2'' squares. I then used brads to hold them together. The sticks are lollipop sticks, that I use when I'm making candy, that I inked using Tim Holtz- Broken China. I then attached the pinwheels to the sticks at varying heights. The grass is a piece of scrap paper that I had and then fringed to make it look more like grass. The clouds were cut from one of the pre-loaded images on the Cricut Imagine and then inked with Tim Holtz- Broken China. Everything except for the grass is popped up using pop dots. I LOVE those things! I use them on almost EVERYTHING! LOL!
One of the group’s funders was the John M. Olin Foundation, which invested millions of dollars in the law and economic movement – endowing university chairs, funding think-tanks and providing early support for the Federalist Society, which was founded in 1982 by former attorney general Ed Meese, controversial Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork and Ted Olsen—who years later would win the infamous Bush v. Gore case before the Supreme Court in 2000 and then go on to serve as Bush’s solicitor general. The foundation said in a 2003 report to its trustees, “All in all, the Federalist Society has been one of the best investments the foundation ever made.”
Oxford reform bill -- another subject on which Gladstone changed his mind, for he had opposed the original commission of a report on reform. Gladstone was unusually willing to change his opinions, but not necessarily willing to be seen as having changed. Gladstone constructed and carried the legislation through parliament in 1864 almost unaided. Opened up Oxford to Dissenters (Gladstone himself opposed including this in the bill while supporting it in principle). Replaced government by the heads of colleges by an elected board. Permitted the opening of private halls at the university in order to provide opportunities for less wealthy students to matriculate (without transgressing the independence of the existing colleges). The bad feeling at Oxford about his role in reform ultimately led to his election defeat of 1865.

Other than a conversation about masturbation, a lesbian kissing scene, and a brief topless sunbathing scene, the movie is appropriate for teens, while still having enough tension to keep older audiences interested. My only criticism with the film is that I would have added a bit more struggle with nature, because of the name of the film and it being a major theme that is not fully exploited.
In the meantime, though: some catching up from last weekend.

Annie and Snow were also captivating to watch. Snow made the classic villainous mistake of underestimating Annie’s intentions towards Eve’s welfare and it cost him his life.

It might be nice to have another main Big Bad that isn’t a supernatural threat.

Cath Campbell's practice to date is dominated by an ongoing enquiry into the status, meaning and fabric of architecture and public space. Taking Modernism as a point of departure Campbell has consistently re-appropriated architectural imagery to create works that reinvent our associations with the built environment. And we said nothing, all the day continues this analysis from the privacy of her dining room table. The work is an ongoing unlimited series of photographs that are presented stacked and leant along a narrow shelf. Taking it's title from a line in John Donne's poem The Ecstasy each photograph is of another photograph chosen as if Campbell is a tourist looking around the city portrayed, taking snaps of things that catch her eye. These Lo-Fi images, which often include the reflection or shadow of Campbell and her Camera on the original photograph, serve to undermine the authoritarian status assumed by the original imagery.

But back to the stone, and the possibility of its being some kind of engraving. It has occurred to me that the stone was carved in the way it is the day before I found it, someone messing about with blade and rock, and then tossing it into the waves; it has also occurred to me - and this is much more fascinating, from a storytelling point of view at least - that the stone is in fact ancient, as is the image and whatever it depicts; but that it was carved by a child, or some talentless fool; that it is not ancient, simply primitive or unsophisticated, and thus thrown away for being useless in the context of the culture it sprang from.
I wasn’t a Christian at the time. I didn’t have my Saviour to lean on. I felt like my parenting days were over. I never wanted to go through this pain again. G’s case worker called and said another caseworker had a case and it was a perfect placement for us. I told her no way, I didn’t even ask my husband, I just knew we couldn’t go through this pain again. She argued with me (we had become close while working with several kids together). I will never forget, she said “just try it for 2 weeks, I know these kids are meant to be yours.” Well we said ok, but we really just felt like we were going to be a temporary placement and in 2 weeks they would have had time to find a long term foster home for them.
I really like Shankar Jaikishan's lovely theme for Bombay Talkie. Its so contemporary it feels like it could have been written yesterday and it has such a soothing, lilting groove that it just grows on you with every listen. Kalyanji's Anadji's music for Zanjeer, on the other hand, has a classic seventies feel to it. I love the melody and the arrangement that accompanies the atmospheric video. R.D. Burman's haunting title music for Caravan has been a favorite of mine for years. It features a great wordless vocal by Usha Iyer as Asha Parekh helplessly drives a runaway car down a mountain. Yikes!

The last couple of weeks have been non-stop in my life. Last week was the busiest with every minute of every day seeming to be filled with something. I got pretty decent sleep every night, but my days were so jam packed full that I think it wore me out.
As much as I love it, it is such a nice treat when I don’t have to cook sometimes. Now that can mean ordering pizza if I’m lacking energy and the husband and I need a low-key night with a movie from Redbox.

Arvo's website lists several staff names and email addresses, and the URL is registered to Arvo General Coordinator Volkan Dogan, who also signed the contract I saw. But Hulya Dayan, who gives her title as "Acquiring Editor," is the only Arvo staff member that anyone has reported dealing with. She's also listed as the translator of many of Arvo's books, despite the shaky command of English exhibited in her emails (several Arvo authors have told me that their translators were hired by the company as independent contractors). So Arvo's staff may be quite a bit smaller than its website encourages viewers to assume.

Schools like YIP, Hyper Island, Kaospilots, Embercombe, Knowmads (of course), Rietveld and many others that aren’t following strict curriculum, schedules, academics, or pumping out humans to join the rat race. All these schools have their unique selling points and each one would give you a completely different learning experience.

Today prompt is to write about my crafting style ...
Police said the blasts had been caused by explosive devices planted in trash bins. Interior Minister Vitaly Zakharchenko immediately left for Dnipropetrovsk to head an investigation, police said.
I’ll start today with our FAVORITE room…..the Sleeping Porch!
I’m so glad I did.
We needed a room for Marissa to be moved into so she could get out of the ICU- God gave us that room even though we were told "There is no way a room will open up today"
As I waited for my train, I scanned the book and read the first line. Nothing captivating but since I had the novel in my hands, my curiosity began to build and I became impatient to see what the hype was about. I got past the first paragraph and proceeded to the next and the next and the next. An hour later, I realized that I was half-way home, still reading, and unable to put the book down.

Vadyn discovered the cabinet.
Gladys the Badiss insists she found out about her dismissal through the media; while President Fete to de Max Richards’ Office say they informed her first…..maybe we should ask Suruj the Interceptor Rambachan and his trusty side-kick Super Dyer? http://www.trinidadexpress.com/news/_Gafoor_was_told_of_suspension_before_media_-139197019.html
There are two places I know of, which lay claim to being Ramayana’s Panchavati – Bhadrachalam and Nasik. I have already given my analysis supporting Bhadrachalam as the correct Panchavati based on Kabandhas directions to Sri Rama as well as its proximity to kosala.
If you get lost along the way, here is the full list of hoppers today:

There's no way to say that stuff about yourself without sounding pretentious as hell. It may be true (I'm sure it is) but it's like telling people your SAT score. I don't really care why you turned to writing novels. I only care if this is one I want to read.
He took us around back to our bungalow down the road and recommended some local restaurants before saying goodnight. We fell asleep as soon as our heads hit the pillow, but the next morning I went around and snapped some more photos of the place.
The second pursuer was a tall man wearing a black dinner jacket with a bow tie. If he had been a human, he would have appeared to be in his early sixties. A shaggy mane of grey hair framed his face. There was a hard and grim expression on it. The Watcher recognised this man. It was another renegade Time Lord, the one known as the Doctor.

“I want a proper school, sir, to teach reading and writing, and most of all thinking, sir, so people can find what they’re good at, because someone doing what they really like is always an asset to any country, and too often people never find out until it’s too late.” From I shall wear Midnight by Terry Pratchett

Then, and here is something I was quite pleasantly surprised by, they informed me they are also using orange peel and coriander in the beer and apparently, according to ABInBev's press office, I'm the only person to know this at the moment because I'm the only person who's asked! How depressing is that?!
Maybe days when you want to throw up into the lap of indecision,
Monday I was able to spend the evening with several of my besties. My sister made a delicious dinner and we just had a great time sitting around the table catching up. I love you girls!!! Thank you sissy for all you did for me while we were there.
The feminist movement introduced an unbelievable amount of tension into the relationships between men and women. Feminism gave us women permission to nag and criticize our husbands, which most women can do just fine without any special permission. The legacy of the feminist movement has been to turn the home, which should be the place of cooperation, into a sphere of competition between men and women. And ironically, feminism, which was supposed to be about getting beyond stereotypes, supported the most negative of stereotypes about men.
On hot summer evenings, I’d step outside to catch a breeze and Marcel would sometimes join me. We’d sit together in my garden, enjoying the stars and the night air. We’d talk about our lives, as much as our different languages would allow, and we’d congratulate ourselves on having the good fortune to be here in Provence, to be happy and healthy and have good people close by.
Remember Gods word in Genesis 50:20 you intended to harm me, but God intended it all for good. He brought me to this position so I could save the lives of many people. Keep this scripture at heart when the adversary tries to attack you.

Oh, and then there was the “Ask Dayton” segment, which for reasons surpassing all comprehension continues to chug merrily along. This week’s question? Well, here you go:
Wasserman-Schultz: how about taxing
Another film that I completely love. This is the first black and white film that I've tried and although its developed with C41 chemicals rather than true black and white chemicals, I still think its fantastic. The tones are soft, yet there are strong contrasts when you need them and combined with my Diana Mini, this film is truly artistic.

So, by the calculations of my nominal math skills, we are spending about $2.50/month for trash disposal.

Is there a Church which has historically existed in every generation since the time of the Apostles and before that in the Prophets?
During the initial years of electricity distribution, Edison's direct current was the standard for the United States, and Edison did not want to lose all his patent royalties. Direct current worked well with incandescent lamps, which were the principal load of the day, and with motors. Direct-current systems could be directly used with storage batteries, providing valuable load-levelling and backup power during interruptions of generator operation. Direct-current generators could be easily paralleled, allowing economical operation by using smaller machines during periods of light load and improving reliability. At the introduction of Edison's system, no practical AC motor was available. Edison had invented a meter to allow customers to be billed for energy proportional to consumption, but this meter worked only with direct current. As of 1882 these were all significant technical advantages of direct current. – Wikipedia
