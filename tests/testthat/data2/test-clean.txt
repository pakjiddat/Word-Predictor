one of the problems we face as lay disciples of jesus is that the modern church is not structured to properly assist lay people who are not part of the religious establishment to follow the personal path of the lord is calling them to follow
the modern church establishment does not expect lay people to enter into such individual
the establishment expects that any one who has such a call to either enter a seminary to become a priest deacon or minister or to join some religious order
it is difficult to overcome the prejudices of the past that have placed lay christians as passive servants of the clergy having no understanding of things spiritual

their solely depends on others approval and not their partners
they are not secure in their committed relationships and obviously feel a lacking somewhere within
they believe of that lack that at any given time their partner will leave or lose interest
as a result they use others outside of the relationship as a way to fill or correct what they feel they are lacking and hope that this will seal some sort of idea in their partners mind that they are super desirable with a boatload of options

i was around for inspiration as mentioned earlier stress not good for my drawing and decided to do an expansion on an unnamed character that i had drawn some years ago in my a of about a size

last monday the th i had an academic planning meeting with my field liaison the director of the program and the director of
essentially my liaison is concerned about me not being able to pass my due to problems that have been occurring over the course of the year
i was initially at the middle school but after about a month and a half i was transferred to the high school due to a lot of issues with my field instructor supervisor
since going to the high school i feel like its been one issue after another
i got really low ratings on my evaluation at the end of first semester and in my opinion they were largely in part to my supervisor not providing supervision like we were supposed to have each week
plus my supervisor continues to believe that i am a clinical level student but a foundation level student
the difference between the two is that the foundation year is the first year of the year program
everyone takes identical classes and its kind of like taking general education classes
except they are specific social work classes
the second year of the program is where you decide between the clinical track or the administration track and your classes and is based on which track you take
so the clinical track is the track that i plan to take next year
my supervisor expects me to be at the level of a clinical student despite that still in my foundation year
this has caused a lot of problems in terms of expectations and experience because just not at the place my supervisor thinks i need to be
needless to say this meeting was a session to come up with ways to make sure i pass
the outcome ended up being in my opinion telling me to just do what i have to do in order to pass
established that i have no desire to be a school social worker so i think thats the biggest problem that my supervisor has with me
that i have a passion to be a school social worker
my passion is working with the military population and people with and mental health disorders
i even loved my job working in foster care
but i despise being in the school setting
i disagree with the policies i feel its a helpful environment and i just plain like it
maybe its the district maybe its me
who knows its just not my cup of tea

for several months now there has been considerable speculation in the community that as well as taking on the george town cruise facilities a cruise pier at cayman turtle farm in west bay and the reconstruction of the at would also be involved in the airport project
earlier this year bush had suggested that the based firm was interested in building the airport but so far there has been no confirmation regarding the proposed plans for roberts
there will be fantastic
i wish i could tell you more but you will just have to come back on january st to see exactly what i am referring to
the agencies both have automated underwriting systems and these systems are initially run by the processor to see what the minimum documentation is and then anything questionable must be documented also
the underwriter then uses their expertise to further analyze the file the documentation and the overall risk factor that may exist
the automated underwriting systems spit out minimum documentation requirements from what has been entered into the system
it is a machine so it cannot see with the human eye and only uses information it has been given by the human therefore there is room for error
when something changes after it is documented income assets liabilities after being verified the automated underwriting system must be changed along with the new information and new underwriting requirements review yet again
as with any process sometimes this has not been done properly therefore underwriting decisions can be made that are not actually the true story as it has been verified
these systems are governed by humans and as we all know humans make mistakes and even though there are explicit guidelines that should be followed there are still errors made that can change the approved status to a declined status
mortgage underwriters and processors have decided that it is best to fully document a file and then there are less risk and more prudent analysis done

i first want to take a look at investors intelligence
over time this has proven to be one of the better gauges of sentiment that i have seen
here is a look over the past years
the keys to look for when looking for a major top are bulls at less than and ratios over
for at least a few weeks
while one rely on this indicator alone it has been quite useful
i want to start with mid and work forward
the market made an initial peak in july before a nasty correction into august
the ratio was over
for close to months straight and bearish readings were below
in october the ratio had a big two week spike and bulls moved below once again
that ended up being the top of the bull run from march october
after the peak sentiment fell off a cliff and never really recovered until late
the ratio spent about months up near
and bearish readings were clearly under
the market then saw a correction in january of or so
now look to april ahead of the flash crash
readings were up near
and bearish sentiment was under
now look at the peak in april
the ratio was over
for the better part of months before that high and actually spiked up to
right before the peak
at that time bearish sentiment was once again under
now look at where we are today
last week was the first time since april that the ratio came close to
and bearish sentiment is still
these are not the kind of numbers one would expect near a major market peak with regard to sentiment
its the present that alone matters

well the past two time that charlie has had a volleyball game we have come home to the side sprinkler turned on
both times the faucet is barely turned
tonight we came home and along with our sprinkler on our mail was on our front porch

the pain in her abdomen feels like fire and knives and she can almost imagine the organs punching deep fangs inside of her body draining her of to feed their growth
she continues to cry and wriggle about actually pulling one arm free and twisting into the grasp of the other captor
she suddenly grasps the person with both hands and smoke curls up from under her hands as milky fluid begins from bulging porous flesh in her palms and finger tips
the liquid eats at the pristine white of the persons uniform causing it to howl in pain as the milk makes contact with the bare skin beneath
the other uniformed being unaware of the cause wraps its arms around her and attempts to pull her off
one of the organs painfully detaches from her body like some sort of creature and attaches itself to the other guards arm and another loud shriek fills the room as it pulls away from her

i think most of the people who hold this view probably started with good intentions
at face value it sounds much friendlier and supposedly this way no ones feelings get hurt and the pressure is off
but who decided that for something to be true it had to be pleasant and accommodating to everyone regardless of any good intentions there is a giant gaping hole in the logic behind making an absolute claim stating that there are no absolute claims
it also shows little knowledge of the worlds religions

i went to the bay sort of like for you us readers and checked out their hosiery section which is actually pretty huge
i expected i would find lots of options since they seem to have so many but i was really really terribly disappointed
they carry hue brand which i was excited about because they come in lots of colors
i started looking through the rack for my size but guess what nothing in my size
i asked an associate where the plus size hosiery was and she directed me back to the hue section
i told her i found anything there and she showed me my size
in black and brown only
big women want to wear color too hello plus size women want more options than black and brown
there even any gray
my cool suave response was with her nodding to my friend

once you figure out how to attach the foot to your machine its actually relatively simple
the motion of the needle drives a sharp bit of metal back and forth causing fabric threaded through a particular part of the foot to bunch up
how much it bunches per stitch is controlled by a little another little lever adjusts whether the gathering takes place on every stitch or only once per so many stitches
this means you can technically use the foot for making as well and control your gathering ratio quite precisely
fabric tension and stitch length also play a role

the staff of senator joe and representative bart wanted to know whether the bubble was just due to supply and demand
relying on the expertise of frank and mike masters two experts on the commodities market i was able to conclude beyond any doubt that it was a speculative bubble driven by a buy and hold strategy adopted by managers of pension funds
hearings were held in congress with guys like mike masters testifying as well as representatives from the airlines and other industries
nick he says with clarity and certainty the certainty with which he can now pronounce the name nick directly related to the clarity that it was actually nick who
which is a total lie
if nick did he do it in our house

now while i can understand that a teacher would be irritated by the end result not being what he had expected although from what i understood it had not been made clear that the work had to reflect the i cannot understand why that teacher was quite so destructive in his comments

i know my mum taught herself to crochet from a book and patiently showed my sister and i how to do it

clearly your idea of exercise is going to the gym and doing and running on the treadmill riding a bike doing whatever it is on the elliptical etc
the fact that there is only minutes of action does not surprise me in the least
but this is hard

shes exactly where i was years ago when i started asking questions about my catholic

only a collective and conscious movement of students around can effectively strengthen it
a movement that collectively ensures that woman students feel confident enough to report cases of harassment and are not forced to retreat owing to mounting social pressures

where women are not forced to constantly adjust their according to the male choices or
bodies and minds are not forced and tortured to adhere to beauty chastity housewife roles and rules the prevalent feudal and morality

as a harvard graduate student i came to know numerous radical activists
i have posed this questions to many of them and in most cases only heard that a new way has to be found or that it is impossible to understand the socialist future when living under capitalist conditions
other activists however told me that they are not against the state as such only against the
that distinction is however irrelevant
because what they criticize in the is first and foremost its power to command and control
unfortunately power is just the aspect of the state that they need in order to implement their projects
the dream of social equality requires more power more coercion and more ideological indoctrination to enforce it
so even if the will be abolished and another unidentified state will rise from its ashes it will still have to exercise power lots and lots of power in order to implement social projects
so we are back at point zero and the paradox remains acute as ever

the only rule i had for daddy and nolan when they went to buy shoes before was no shoes and this time with them and without thinking i told nolan he could have starwars shoes
so now he has shoes well see how long the lights keep flashing
and because he got star wars shoes daddy and nolan had to watch the star wars clone wars cartoon so he would know that his shoes were supposed to look like storm troopers

we have been fortunate that this damaged presidency has occurred during a time of relative peace and prosperity
in times of war or national emergency it is often necessary for the president to call upon the nation to make great economic and personal sacrifices
in these occasions our president had best be truth teller whose life of principled leadership and integrity we can count upon
some commentators have suggested that with the president having less than two years left in his term of office the easiest approach is to let the clock expire while hoping that he is sufficiently careful if not contrite to avoid reckless and indefensible conduct
but as senators we know that the dangers of the world constantly threaten us
rarely do two years pass without the need for strong presidential leadership and the exercise of substantial moral authority from the white house

part of being an ethical christian parent is admitting that we need grace as much as our children do and we always have

the relationship lasted for just over a year until de untimely death from tuberculosis only two days after her st birthday in
over the year feelings became close to an obsession and each meeting and word from de took on almost a religious significance
de herself was a catholic was a scientific
he saw de as his moral superior and began to infuse his theories of the human condition with a more religious
he concluded that cults and celebrations are indispensable for mankind although he still leaned away from catholicism and the traditional church

anyway enough and onto the crafting
this week has seen the birthday of a friend who has become especially dear to me
elaine is one of my craft stamping quartet buddies as many of my visitors already know and along with jo and judith she has become one of the main constants in my life so making a card incorporating things she likes was such a pleasure to do
elaine loves nature and has a huge wild garden with lots of mature trees and i know she loves it in whatever coat it happens to be wearing
as its september i decided to go with an autumnal look both with the i used and also with the leaf embellishments
elaine knows one of my things to do is blending inks over masks and as chocolate baroque have just started stocking some exceptionally pretty prima ones which i resist buying i thought thats where i would start my design
i followed this with some light using a stamp from an set called autumn fall which i must have had for at least years and never inked up
shame on me because the stamps are really dainty with lovely leafy
however expect honesty fairness or anything approaching truth from channel four or any western media
back to the lecture at hand
the challenge is more than one fold so i have made an easel card used this lovely stamped image from hooked on craft called honey bears with mounted on round die cuts backing paper is capsule flowers and foliage from
the sentiment is from cindy ribbon lace and button from stash
the change is unnecessary
challenging this change also draws attention to the fact that is very much in favor of history for it has just as much to do with our future

london porter always strikes me as a easy drinking porter with not too much roasted malt and a lighter body
there are some sweeter almost notes that paired nicely with the more intense and buttery taste of the cheese like a complementary relationship with one side making up in the places the other lacks
not that either lack anything as far as taste goes but you get my drift good accompaniment
the carbonation battled the delicious saltiness and lifted the and proteins that coated the tongue
a solid pairing even for going a little out on a limb
but maybe if i keep doing it then i might start having to let go less and less and then before long i will have let go without even it

the poems found within the covers of her latest poetry collection shadow crossing are often enigmatic although some general comments can be proffered
the first eleven poems are grouped under the section title the path of no return
here the path can perhaps be interpreted as the arc of an individual life as the poems tend to deal with significant formative experiences the cruelty absurdity and mystery of life and possible responses to such
the first poem in apogee lays out the need to understand the forces that shape us in its opening lines

she bent to pick up the little ceramic lamp and filled it with oil from the captains flask
when the lamp to life she found she was in a room shaped much like the one above except this one was carved and polished rock salt
shining like crystal the chamber was a faceted dome with the stone ladder descending like a column down the center
four carved spaced equally led from the room
there was a tinkling sound coming from each and gasped to see small streams of water running down the center of each hallway to splash through grates at the threshold of each as they entered the chamber where she stood
she had lost her sense of direction and so turned to the nearest

its pretty awesome though we decided my new title is administrative specialist

its a pretty intense job compared to what i have done the past two years compared to what i have been doing for my the past months
i love it but i am going to be so so so happy once its all done
the pressure is on too because we want this big job done by the end of the year

but i thrive on that and enjoy developing efficiency procedures for myself which enable me to turn projects around more quickly and hand them off upon completion

subject matter is an important element in novel writing
what who and when are issues that can determine the impact a novelist makes on the publishing community
for a publisher marketing issues are paramount
since the public is notoriously fickle in its interests the publishing often has to anticipate what will most engage the public mind in the twelve to eighteen months it will take for a mainstream publisher to produce and market a book
for it is a lot easier to anticipate
for fiction publishers need to consult a psychic

in all things the needs of the state come first and woe to him who thinks to stand in its way

it was a gorgeous new york an inch and a half thick and cooked to perfection and for some reason the smell of it made me want to hurl
i only ever avoid food when i am stressed and for me to avoid steak there is something seriously up
it was horrible
nothing in the world could make me take a bite of the meat
i had to put it in the other room

the male crisis is a difficult subject to bring up around some people since it exists primarily as a physiological condition
yes us guys have to deal with such things like an unwanted horizontal expansion at the waistline or an accelerated retreat of the we at least can exercise to fight the growing bulge or buy medicinal remedies to battle an war to keep something fuzzy on our heads
no this is something that affects guys on a far deeper level see i will be honest here and write something that should be adult males never really grow up

doctors what do they know
i take a moment and reflect
i know that everyone has their own trials in life if not currently they have had or will have
but how easy it is to look at complete strangers and imagine how perfect their lives must be in comparison to my own
i know from my own experience that a smile can do a pretty good job of concealing the mountain of hurt inside me
certainly the same holds true for the rest of the world
any showdown of resentment or jealousy that up toward the happy perfect people is a waste of time and energy
of what benefit is it to compare myself to others god created us all uniquely and no two life experiences could possibly be the same
to utilize the worn out saying it is comparing apples to oranges it would be very very easy to let the bitterness seep through my veins like a deadly poison
at times it is tempting to let go and collapse into a heap of defeat and letting the waves take me under
its during these times of weakness that my spiritual survival instinct kicks in
i know to call out to jesus
without fail he rescues me and guides me back into the shallow waters

so i made a of coffee grabbed my book retrieved my glasses and took to my reading on the porch saying to myself ok amy you get an hour until it gets too hot and then you must get back to finishing the report on your project be expecting next week
well after an hour and the first cup of coffee i forced myself to break from the adventures of ruth the new york times restaurant critic who entertains with her beguiling tales of disguises and in the manhattan restaurant scene
a pang of hunger finally hit me after no supper last night and all these mouth watering food descriptions
i wondered how it had taken so long actually
ok amy i said to myself make yourself a sunday breakfast enjoy the next chapter and a bit more of the breeze as accompaniments and then hit the computer
i keep reminding myself that this will pass
we waited so long for her
this is just a little bump in the road
i wont even remember it when i am watching her graduate college get married or have her first baby
there is so much more ahead
this is nothing

i ended up making a pretty gourmet lunch today
it was mostly rearranging some leftovers but it came together very nicely
the other day at the store i saw artichokes that looked really awesome
when i was a kid used to make artichokes for us and she taught us how to peel off the leaves one by one dip them into a butter sauce and then pull them between your teeth for the one small bite that was at the base of each leaf
its a lot of work but it is worth it because it is so good
to make the artichoke just put some water in a pan and steam the artichoke for minutes or until the leaves pull off very easily
the butter sauce i did today was super simple melted clarified butter with vinegar and salt
lemon juice is extraordinary with artichokes but i have any lemons
dog what was that did you hear that did you hear that did you hear that lets go look

the process is not simply one way
leaves draw from the sun through
in this way the public language reaches down into the roots
just as the roots end at the leaves the leaves end at the very tip of the roots

this will also apply to clothing and on the character i will need to consider that things may have changed for the character in the future setting than it would be in modern times

having said all of this my conclusion is that precedent was set with the very institution of the wild card rule and that the rule that is currently in effect has absolutely nothing to do with setting ones qualification for worlds
therefore my conclusion is that should simply disband the rule altogether as it really serves no useful purpose and merritt or any other athlete should be the wild card pass that they earned when they finished first in the previous world championships

it is also fairly idiotic in that he is so correct the author discusses what foods use the least amount of natural resources to produce require little of our dwindling water supply and cause a minimal amount of pollution
does any really care about such things when putting together the evening meal does it matter to anyone that farmers are probably more concerned about such things than you they are not in the business of running up the water bill if mother nature will provide some rain
they are not in the business of polluting the food crops on which they depend

a very common thread however is that professors are becoming disillusioned by the lack of maturity of undergraduate students
this semester seems to be the worst by my observation for professors spelling out the rules that should be common sense
cell phones must be completely off and cannot be out during class
assignments must be turned in on time
excuses that will be accepted for missed exams and assignments are very narrow
extra credit is no longer being offered because of past abuses by previous classes

there is nothing magical going on as the author has opted to instead focus on the creatures and technology which appears aplenty towards the end
overall flowed well but the middle was a little slow with the romance aspect taking a bit too much time to cement itself
there is plenty of action and witty dialogues along the way to things keep moving a pace
the dialogue and own internal thoughts were the best aspect
i thought the properness of it all would grain on me after a time but the author so much humor that she averts that chasm to the point where i looked forward to having things made more formal again to appreciate the jokes and situations

some potential weaknesses of analysis are the following
in approach the turbulent would have taken place in interior for over two billion years
in this time interior properties would be likely to change due to the heat transferred to the surface and the amount of sulfur and silicate compounds deposited on the surface
it seems doubtful that the interior properties could support this type of for such a long time
secondly the time scale of the build up of the mantle hot spots or magma chambers from model is only years yet the time frame of the orbital oscillations is on the order of million years
these two phenomena should be related in some realistic way if tidal dissipation is the primary heat source in io
also assumed a high temperature value at the beginning of the resonance period in history
this high temperature would stem from radioactive decay in early history and a proposed period of greater tidal dissipation in the past as orbit was evolving into resonance
considering other studies of heat from radioactive decay from an evolutionary viewpoint this temperature may be unrealistic
most other studies of interior use temperatures of approximately or
considering it may be before they get to laying eggs it be a good idea to get a few old hens a lady was selling young ones on

having a baby let alone twins was not in and my plans
when we first found out that was pregnant we asked all the typical first time parent questions
how are we going to do this where are we going to get that when will we fit this in and how will we do that deep down we knew that god would take care of everything but we still had a tendency to wonder and ask those kinds of questions
we knew that god has a perfect track record in terms of taking care of his children but still how is twins going to work for us have you ever been there before wondering how god is going to come through my guess is that you have and that as you look back on that experience you are only reminded of gods faithfulness and his incredible provision

this nobel prize winner of dna was being insulted by journalists

this will not be easy
there have been many reasons that trust has been broken in this presbytery
feelings have been hurt deeply
relationships have been strained and broken

helen is a maid working at the same hotel as albert
she falls madly in love with joe aaron johnson a poor young man who managed to fix the hotels heating
joe dreams of leaving for america and wants to take helen with him
he makes helen go out on dates with albert who has quite a fancy for helen in order to get gifts that they could sell in order to buy tickets for their sea voyage

my has promised me the best gift ever
her waking up with each morning and letting me sleep in
shes even going to let us use her brand new bedroom furniture in her room upstairs and sleep in the guest room while sleeps in my old room so we really wont hear her and can just get some rest
i think thats better than any christmas present i could ask for i am really looking forward to it
on the flip side we have really on decorating around here
i guess its because we know were leaving a week from tomorrow and well be in ohio for a week so there was really no point in getting our house all decked out here when we wont be here to enjoy it

granted the injunction substantially in the terms sought except that he refused to prohibit disclosure of the bare facts that i and were in a relationship and that ii is the father of twins
for the sake of clarity he stated that he was not ordering that any disclosure be made nor was he anyone to make that disclosure he was just declining to prohibit it by an injunction

this being so an injunction was neither necessary nor proportionate
well writing to me is passion the passion to mark my words with something i feel deeply attached with

writing is the passion for me to strive struggle to reach that limit and then set an even higher limit to achieve

under our form of government the use of property and the making of contracts are normally matters of private and not of public concern
the general rule is that both shall be free of governmental interference
but neither property rights nor contract rights are absolute for government cannot exist if the citizen may at will use his property to the detriment of his fellows or exercise his freedom of contract to work them harm
equally fundamental with the private right is that of the public to regulate it in the common interest

watch how they are looking in awe of everything around them
take them outside
place them under a tree and watch as they are completely captivated
when is the last time you really looked at a tree or on that note anything if you look with your full being the experience is breathtaking
our problem is that we mentally label everything
and once we label things we stop looking deeply
we lose depth in our perception of things
we look at the tree and label it tree and look again
we are missing all the beauty magic abundance and life around us

about five minutes later i saw a restaurant over on the side of the road a neon highlighted sign spread across its roof
the sign read

yesterday my old daughter had an incident at school

do you set rules for yourself regarding how you mention your children and social media what are they do you think its possible to gossip about your own kids or does gossip only apply to talking about those outside your family
respect renew and refresh
take time to rest and love the bodies that you are occupying for this physical experience you participate in
too many times we see them abused or neglected
we wish to just remind you that there are many more experiences ahead
live through them making the healthy choices that will enhance the journey of this life you have chosen
doing so will allow you to focus on the sacred contract you have laid out for yourself with zest and focus

today there were charity rides
i could only do one and that people off
i have to stay true to myself and do what i want to do
i refuse to have people dictate to me
the one i chose had riders
two accidents one bad
the bad one went down right behind me and i heard it and saw it
lets just say that put a huge damper on the run of miles all around south florida
then i had to pull off and in middle of the ride when i realized that the ride was not ending anytime soon
plus i was over the run by that point
when i tried to jump back in at the end after taking pictures the cops got let me rejoin the group and threatened me
i got and left
hey got to be true to me he says

while we haunted by ghosts the night we stayed at the shaffer one of the women that worked at the hotel was being stalked by an who threatened to shoot everyone inside
he drove by a couple times and the police were called
at one point while eating in the restaurant we were asked to step away from the front window
for a few minutes we drank our tea by the cash register waiting to see which way things would go
but in the end there was no gunfire at the shaffer that night surely how pop would prefer it
the other bottle was something of a mystery

they have seven regular beers but cold north wind barley wine one of them
richard know if the bottle he got was new aged or what just that the proprietor was keen for him to have it

cooking the tomatoes in the skillet instead of just adding them raw concentrates their

there is a direct line from the aspirations of dadaism to waste land
but unlike so many developments informed by it waste land does not take that first fateful individualistic step that mostly tends to existential absurdity and despairing irony
in the film recycling is a collective act in more than one sense of the word collective
the associated labour process that reclaims materials previously designated as useless entails the of these materials as useful
what is more this transformation is from stuff not having as privately owned property to stuff having as collectively owned property
at the level of then the art work is socialist property
when i followed weight watchers i learned that fiber was great
the more fiber you eat in something the fewer points it had which meant that you got to eat more
i liked that
i care about much beyond that
that is silly of me especially considering the fact that i just mentioned how much sadness i have about all of this
i think one thing that i am really sad about is that stayed in such a situation for so long
put myself and through
my was so damaged and i had absolutely no that i accepted things that were not acceptable

wisdom is not in analysis
you suffer and by analysis you try to find the cause that is you are analyzing a dead event the cause that is already in the past
what you must do is find the cause of suffering in the very moment of suffering
by analyzing suffering you do not find the cause you analyze only the cause of a particular act
then you say i have understood the cause of that suffering
but in reality you have only learned to avoid the suffering you have not freed your mind from it
this process of accumulation of learning through the analysis of a particular act does not give wisdom
wisdom arises only when the i consciousness which is the creator the cause of suffering is dissolved

now we have and now we have yet another style of training
so far least in puppy training has been all
we give treats for sit and treats for down and treats for wait and treats for this and treats for that and we play the drop it game in which we distract the pups from chewing on our socks and shoes and other contraband by scattering treats across the ground and merrily singing drop it and they abandon the sock and scramble after the treats and eventually they will abandon the sock on the command no treats necessary
my reluctance to perform in an ensemble also stemmed from watching the previous school concert when i was hosting it
seeing how some of my juniors struggled on stage and not holding the instrument and the bow correctly reminds me about myself

in place of the will be whatever is double your replacement of the

now obviously having kids everywhere is going to be a constant reminder of why trying to fight the disease but the kids represent more than that
the lack of parents has left the kids to form a microcosm within the town and ignoring the grownups and engaging in their very own politics and battles
some third world country who has fallen out of favor with the groups
the law explained for example in the de decision is quite clear
student associations do not have the same status as trade unions
they are not entitled to impose their strike votes on their members as trade unions are
students contract for education services and pay however little
they are entitled to have the classes they contract and pay for
they suffer great prejudice if they lose their semester
the on the other hand can still protest if they feel like it despite the injunctions
tuesday march a farmer in the district was assaulted on the farm by workers of a farm belonging to the south african national roads agency

brown talks a big game on morals and personal character yet he is frequently shown up on these very characteristics
he his staff and his government have been caught out countless times for lying and it is an characteristic of this labour government that they will only speak to their version of events and their version of the truth
this is of course never an accurate reflection of real life of the real situation of the real statistics or experiences of people
in the conversation with mrs duffy today he was untruthful to her
when she asked what he was going to do about the debt he replied he would cut in in half in four years
the labour policy as i have written about before is in fact not to cut debt in four years but to cut the deficit in four years
a liar to the very end

field event competitors too with long jump high jump shot put and discus relays and others where the marks of four competitors are totaled together to determine a team winner
it all leads to tremendous excitement

merle in the growth of american thought argued that social admirably suited the needs of the great captains of industry who were crushing the little fellows when these vainly tried to compete with them
henry steel wrote in the american mind that darwin and spencer exercised such sovereignty over america as george iii had never enjoyed
and of course robert has said that social offered a perfect moral justification for americas gilded age when robber barons controlled much of american industry the gap between the rich and poor turned into a chasm urban slums and politicians were bought off by the wealthy
the modern conservative movement has embraced social with no less fervor than it has condemned

another way depicts the philosophers as leading up to is by treating falsehood as a kind of world in its own right and the apprehension of falsehood as a separate matter from discerning truth
then the pagan philosophers can be conceded to have done the easier task recognizing what is false without being able to find truth
this depends upon a reversal of classical predicates now the false is evident and the true is hidden
truth compels men with its essential force only when god releases it from concealment

compared to these concerns the questions at issue in the case canada
might be rather pedestrian
at least it does not appear from the judgment that the federal government or the are opposed as a matter of principle or policy to inquiry into the shady dealings in its construction industry and that links with the provincial government
might this change if the inquiry uncovers links between that industry and the federal government as a report by the globe mail suggests it well may but given the sheer volume of the information it is asked for the is probably concerned about the costs of complying with the request as it is with preserving the secrecy of its inquiry methods and sources
the court however suggests that these concerns are overstated capable of being addressed by the cooperation with the commission of inquiry and with provincial police
as for the constitutional position the court holds that a commission of inquiry set up pursuant to provincial law can validly subpoena the and request information in its possession so long as it does not inquire about the administration
the as the supreme court has held is not part of the civil service and does not enjoy the same immunities from provincial inquiries as the federal crown or its servants

all new york state and city agencies have felt the crunch

one of my favorite areas to teach is writing
i think that a students writing truly shows the growth over a year
i know that in the past i have always enjoyed going back to my childhood and seeing just what i was like as a child
since i began my first year of teaching i have always wanted to create this same experience for my students
every year i keep all of the writings that we complete in a big container
then at the end of the year we pull that container out and we sort through the students writing
this has definitely become one of our favorite days of the year
i love hearing the students reflect on all of their learning through the year and it always makes them so proud of their accomplishments
i love the fact that i can send my students into their next school year as proud and writers

your average territory cattle is deeply concerned about how his or her livestock is treated
all farmers with cattle care about their livestock and take pains to make sure that the animals are as happy as possible
but how to get this message across into the metro media the place that conditions government responses to issues that arise from time to time in the public sphere this is the challenge
its not easy but its not impossible either
i wrote this post in the hope that it can help farmers to understand the dynamics of the metro media from the point of view of a journalist
a lot of metro news outfits do not take stories now due to the difficult economic times newspapers are facing
but that mean that you cant get your message across
for many newspapers staff journalists are in constant contact with public relations operatives who send them story ideas in the same way that a will pitch a story to editors and journalists working for a news vehicle

as a working woman and single mother my mother could not afford to accompany me to the large junior high school where school testing was provided
i arrived at the school of four wing locations after walking alone from the bus stop which let me off about a from the school
i walked alone quickly speaking to no one and soon arrived on campus confused about which entrance to enter
after two failed attempts i approached a caucasian woman just arriving on the parking lot and asked about where to find the school testing entrance
she turned out to be the school psychologist who would conduct the testing and i walked with her into the school
she was nice talking comfortably with me she felt safe to me
i liked her and soon was not afraid anymore

first i visited every site i could possibly find on pod from sheer vanity publishers like and vantage to a multitude of subsidy publishers and even traditional publishers who had set up a sister subsidy wing as an example of this authors
i and recorded all the information i could find
let me also add i read a number of books on including those by mark levine and dan among others
i also found various writing forums which were immensely informative
my approach with the forums if possible was to observe as a guest for a period of time and then register at a later date
several on i could not be bothered with
they are either too little frequented or full of
one of the better forums is called
it is on my links
i do regularly visit this forum but have never posted to it
thats not because it is not an excellent forum but if honest i simply do not think it digs deeply enough into the publishing business rather it discusses the same issues and yet even then barely scratches the surface

top developer treasury holdings is in the wars with
in january had receivers appointed to a slew of treasury properties and companies treasury got upset and applied to the high court in dublin for a judicial review of dealings with its loans the courts last month granted treasury its wish for a judicial review which is set to take place in the coming months
treasury is according to and it seem to be disputed by any party insolvent it has loans of
from and its assets are worth half that so that says the company was insolvent to the tune of
so naturally enough given it is facing into an expensive court case where it will defend its dealings with loans sought security for its costs should it win of course
this preliminary point was set to come before the high court yesterday but just beforehand came to an agreement with treasury which is reported by the irish times today and is as follows

she is the most independent person i have ever known she could do anything and she taught me about the importance of counting on yourself and learning how to solve problems and situations alone

heres one of my favorite choral groups the ray charles singers
lately i just been able to get enough of the different choral groups there just enough time in the day to listen to all the records i want to hear besides the fact that this record is by the ray charles singers i bought it for the cover art and because its by command records
i have too many of the command records but i find that starting to look out for these more and more
one thing i did find puzzling about this particular record is that both the cover and the label say stereo but when i recorded it i see that there were two different tracks
and in some of the songs the mens voices sound kind of distant
wondering if maybe the record could have been

the format of the book is largely lists bullet points and short paragraphs
its laid out in such a way that its very easy to navigate and titles are relatively short too
roberts has a lot of statistics and numbers in this book which make it a lot easier to sift through for someone without much time and the numbers are all very consistent
what i look for whenever i see someone throwing around statistics is consistency
a lot of authors will use statistics in one place but not the other all for the sake of a point making
sound like much but if that translates to a lot of authors will prefer to use the big number for the shock value
roberts though keeps everything consistent
if he cited a percentage two sentences ago he will cite a percentage later in the paragraph
i see a lot of games in his writing which makes his claims come across as being more meaningful
upon doing research of my own i did find several different findings for any one thing he cited for example percentage of clicks by page rank
the findings all fall within a very tight range a difference between all findings of which roberts tends to cite more conservative figures
meaning he tends to cite statistics on the lower end of the range

consider the following hebrew verbs express not the time of an action but rather whether the specified action is complete or incomplete
tenses can usually be fairly easily assigned to such verbs although less easily in prophetic writings where there are rapid shifts back and forth among past present and future
but in assigning tenses translators will often choose to leave the element because english has only awkward ways to handle that
hebrew displays much less subordination of one clause to another than does english and in general it lacks our great variety of words that indicate logical connections between clauses and phrases
in hebrew narrative sentence units tend to be strung out one after another in boxcar fashion and to be hooked together by means of a single connective that is usually translated and in the
then would represent the hebrew connective not merely with and but with when but however and so on depending on context or at times would simply omit it
greek verbs indicate time of action more definitely than hebrew verbs do but they also indicate nature of action whether linear recurring or completed
greek verbs are thus very complete in meaning and translators who attempt to capture all of the potential meaning will risk overloading their english and producing a translation so clumsy as to be

greg is white with short reddish brown hair and dresses tastefully
he has been a solitary practitioner of and for a number of years not sure exactly how long
robert is black with and dressed casually for the occasion
he is pagan and somewhat new to

here is the nation news report on thursdays public meeting about the chancery lane long beach project
generally not a bad piece of reporting by the nation
you should read the article on their website but well publish the whole thing here because the nation has been known in the past to stories and change the historical record for political reasons
so we bought a couple of antennas from big lots for each

in the meantime seeing our son so interested in everything his dad does and proudly learning various tasks makes my heart hurt
in a world where technology has nearly everything i find myself crossing my fingers that he stays interested in using his hands to create manipulate and produce things
using those same hands to out on a keyboard is fine too
not unless the is being which it was this morning as i tried to finish up this post then yes i was fully but my hope for him is that he winds up wanting to build stuff instead of building

we are presented with what is literally a desert island and as if the has fundamentally misunderstood the science of marketing to his mind the glamour and enchantment of his product lies in its desolation
the isles are inevitably to us we are promised that only reptile life is to be found on the and that no voice no low no howl is heard the chief sound of life here is a hiss
it will eventually transpire however that there are plenty of men and beasts upon the isles leaving us to wonder at this fable against commodity in which a talented salesman has been enchanted to promote death and despair as attractive products
with the quick wit and beady eye of a travel agent the us with some of his islands
all in all these options fostered which is nice
while playing my bounty hunter for example i could make decisions based on how i feel my character would operate in the game world i chose to have him be the sort who does not deviate from his employers instructions and any time an presented an alternative offer i either refused it
i could have also played my character as the who was only interested in credits and would his employer if it earned him more cash
plus there were times when i could refuse or accept offers in a cruel or kind manner allowing me to further personalize my character he ended up adhering to his contracts stipulations and would if the bounty called for it but otherwise would not be excessively ruthless
a capture or would have him lean heavily toward capture
we were able to pull the man of the hour aside for a few moments and talk about the beginnings of his success some of his proudest moments as well as his influences and inspirations

zoe with an allusion to bergson and his notions of concrete and abstract time tries to render the forces within our social terrain visible and remove the confusion that bergson would constantly refer to in his ideas on time matter and memory
strauss wants the viewers of these pieces to be realized and to know that they are existent because they truly are
the viewers experiences juxtaposed with those in the photographs renders this distinction more real
for the viewer they become a part of this coming into existence as they travel through the spatial enunciation of this identity recorded in a visually material literature
a material language that is read through their active participation in the construction of these spaces meaning and recording in history
to turn this image on its head and give voice to those who in society were told that their voice could only be validated through certain schema or blocks in the social terrain of human experience

the movie stars lloyd nolan in his second of seven appearances as michael so its pretty obvious that he a private detective is the hero of the piece

according to this passage we are to examine ourselves and investigate our walk with utmost care
i pray for wisdom and discernment as much as possible
to be wise is to walk watchfully looking at and carefully examining everything with which we come in contact
as far as discernment goes it is also something that we must diligently pray for and practice
as we walk circumspectly to investigate and examine everything we are being discerning
when we walk this way we will know what the will of the lord is and obey it
we will be pilots who know the way
we will know where we are going and why
we will know what we believe and why we believe it
on the other hand those who do not walk circumspectly are like the pilot who does not know what port he is heading for
to him no wind is the right wind
that what the says that there are no absolutes we must walk circumspectly of what the world thinks or does

unfortunately a real problem arises in a democracy because many people perhaps most will want to move in the most positive sounding direction regardless of how it flies in the face of the reasonable facts
if these ill informed hope driven people are the majority then the whole community will be guided by irrational hope and their collective actions will be no better than a riotous mobs
what is a fair minded person to do when they find themselves being driven into a chaos of obvious disaster what are we to do when nearly all of our present population of seven billion people are eagerly heading into the inevitable boom and its equally inevitable population bust i know the only reasonable thing is to prepare for the after effects of the coming disaster and prepare for a of humanity
when obvious things have passed over it may be possible to rebuild humanity on a more permanent foundation of a world constitution with as its goal the long term survival of the human species rather than the short term of personal gain
give the people of the future the tools they need to form an equitable society
that would include a world constitution and the seeds to the world

formed in kinney the band functioned as a three piece and had three different drummers over the course of its existence has often been as part of the riot movement
however if one reads sara engaging girls to the front the true story of the riot revolution kinney appears to be the belated second wave of the movement a culmination of its best intentions if you will
this is not to say connection has somehow been fabricated or imagined but rather after reading it would seem the formal movement just as its effects example kinney began to emerge
sure tucker played in one of the quintessential acts of the early heavens to betsy but the and depth that kinney exhibited probably would have developed on its own
yet it would be hard to deny that gave it a solid foundation upon which to build and space in which dominate

however as a fellow writer i understand that it takes time for fantasy worlds to brew and come to the boil so i forgive him
if you are a patient sort do try him out i think this series will be seen as a classic in years to come

this year i was fortunate enough to acquire some earthworms meant for a worm bin
i gave up on the bin fairly quickly and just dumped all the worms into the compost pile
when it came time to screen the compost i pulled out literally hundreds of worms and gave them to my mother who keeps a worm farm
the compost was beautiful the worms helped break down the pile much faster and i will be adding them every spring from now on
but if you have access to earthworms worry if your pile is on the ground the worms will find it and work their magic on it without your help
adding worms yourself just makes the process happen a little faster
supposing that during a national emergency and while the legislature is in session the legislators woke up one morning to find that there was extreme scarcity of imported food fuel building materials equipment required in agriculture and industry etc
because of a monopoly hoarding injurious speculation manipulation private controls and or that there were widespread lockouts and strikes paralyzing transportation commerce and industry or rampant espionage or sabotage endangering the very life and security of the nation
how much time would it take the legislature to enact the necessary legislation in order to cope with the situation and pass the necessary emergency measures

rumors are always swirling around everything specifically in sports
the is not currently looking to expand nor do i think they will look to do so in the decade
the only professional sports league that has more than teams is the and any league is nuts if they believe they can compete with roger
contraction however is a different issue
do i think that the league has financially healthy teams no
but is it really helpful to contract teams not too sure about that but it surely look good public if the league shuts down franchises that it granted just a couple decades ago
no sports league has an even playing field when it comes to money because every franchise is run differently and various markets respond differently to everything
the needs to find a way to get a more even keel for all teams
never going to prevent the or the new or the or from dominating the market financially
but there are ways to balance the playing field immensely and make sure that the tampa bays and are able to fairly compete

after you have been relieved of your debt start setting some savings goals
figure out what it is saving for how much money you will need and about how long it will take you to get to that goal in order to achieve it
when figuring out how much you will need to save it would be best to save the same amount each period
this time frame of saving must be realistic or else you will just get discouraged and it will push you further and further from your goal
so those are my celebrity
what do you think who are yours id love to hear about them
right now they are doing chores together so they will be done faster so they can go to the store with me

sometime a glimpse i get to steal
the world its big prizes both in money and honors for but one thing and that is initiative
what is initiative ill tell you
it is doing the right thing without being told
but next to doing the thing without being told is to do it when you are told once
that is to say carry the message to garcia those who can carry a message get high honors but their pay is not always in proportion
next there are those who never do a thing until they are told twice such get no honors and small pay
next there are those who do the right thing only when necessity kicks them from behind and these get indifference instead of honors and a for pay
this kind spends most of its time polishing a bench with a hard luck story
then still lower down in the scale than this we have the fellow who will not do the right thing even when someone goes along to show him how and stays to see that he does it he is always out of a job and receives the contempt he deserves unless he happens to have a rich pa in which case destiny patiently awaits around the corner with a stuffed club

some do have tons of friends
and nothing wrong with that
some are quite happy with only a few friends
nothing wrong with that either
different people are happy with different amounts of social stimulation and more or less

i have said it before and will keep saying it by and large have no sense of their own history
wed rather pave a parking lot than preserve an old building and wed rather build a generic limestone and center most of all
wed rather look like every other city in the than a place with a colorful and unique history
we mistake newness for progress
but all america is going this way
since we no longer have any roots or sense of place for some reason we demand that every city we live in look the same
that is wrong and worse that is boring

the old tentative title no longer fits the story
i like this story and i love how it just took off and really flourished into what it is now

my son the picky one brought this chicken recipe home during his december break
it was his new favorite and he wanted me to make it
i obliged
it is now a favorite of the whole family
we liked it so much that i made a couple of big batches of the spice mix to have around since well be eating so much of it a friend made it for curtis at school but they got it from
perez as it was posted on
i made a couple of changes such as adding honey to the sauce to balance the acidity and slicing the chicken halves in half so they are not so thick and therefore cook through easier
i will give you the recipe as it
for the record curtis likes it done with the thick chicken and i suggest if you choose to keep the intact like that that after browning them on each side finish them for minutes in a degree oven so they cook all the way through
if i prove to be a success of any measure going to have on the order of about seedlings so if in the silicon valley and want a possibly obstinate yet productive tomato plant just say the word

think fetch is an game think again
like the regular it features a long handle that lets you pick up the ball and throw it again and again without bending or touching the on the ball
the soft bouncy ball is gentle on surroundings such as furniture and easy for your dog to carry around in his mouth
the bright coloring also makes it great for dogs with poor eyesight

the preceding paragraphs were written shortly after february when the waco massacre occurred
one would have to be blind not to see the many losses of liberty that have occurred since then
the following article will explain how and why we are losing our constitution
gratitude its no secret that i believe gratitude is important and there a moment that goes by during the day when i do not say thank you to one of my children for whatever they are doing
it is literally at the end of nearly every sentence i speak to them and most other people i come in contact with
when you approach a person or situation from a state of gratitude like love you acknowledge and validate the individual or experience as having value and purpose
if you think of it please pray for us
reliving this is very difficult
the enemy loves putting negative in our heads making us question why we are doing this to ourselves
but we know we are doing exactly what god has told us to do
we are living our genesis
the second is failure to apply the lessons of admitted mistakes
to its credit the government has admitted the failings of education but the nevertheless plans to forge ahead with a national health system without considering the states capacity constraints

lets see if we can get another streak going next saturday
the new record feels like a great combination of everything done as a band up to this point explains lambert
it has hooks breakdowns as well as bringing back all of the gang vocals and gang singing varied styles of screaming and it has a faster more punk influenced in a lot of places that were really excited about
we all grew up as kids listening to pop punk as well as and metal so it feels right having the faster paced and more intense feel in the new songs while as the same time adding even and more pop oriented choruses
maybe we should take a moment and breathe
stop trying to push god into our box and let him take things at his own pace
no need to rush perfection
let him take care of everything
right now all thats out of the way been holding this in all and i need to get it out published
its best to get away from the city now and meet thousand year old villagers and really try to understand why the issue is more complicated than a simple man caused disaster than simply feudalism

writing about a german immigrant in minnesota in the early th century was almost an autobiography in though i were writing in a dark inverted mirror

the story last spring sara came to a prima rehearsal laughing and telling us that shed just seen an ad in the shopper for goats for sale

but what truly kept nagging me as the film wore on was the question of why i was supposed to be thrilled by the police out these nondescript people in this building
i call it per se certainly not in the way that say the elite squad is this is perhaps the one area where the films lack of story works if it had even a whisper of one it would likely be in support of this police brutality
there is something though unsettling about how gleefully the film moves into a brawl especially given that the first building resident the audience meets is a decent meek man just trying to get medicine to his wife
how many others like him are caught in the of this raid

as i have previously held no particular view over the ancient lineage claims for witchcraft and in great britain and their authenticity or lack thereof and because i have followed a largely intuitive path similar perhaps to that of a in my relative independence of groups and traditions as regards my own awareness of pagan and nature issues and of what i shall term and its apprehension in daily life i have found this volume to be informative enjoyable and unexpectedly provocative
that there ensues some degree of partisan prejudice was almost to be expected as the wider public may still hold various perspectives based on an until recently dominant christian cultural ideology and its ensuing against and witchcraft in particular
that such views should apparently inform an objective academic in his choice of how to handle his subject matter is not a question that i am well enough equipped to consider
i would surmise however by saying that i have learned a lot by reading this work both within the tome itself and further by becoming aware of sensible and informed dissent without

i remember the first time i watched

even now its one of my favorite movies
sure its adorable and funny but i think the movie sends out a strong message to young women you can be your own hero

you can defeat any enemy on your own

it was like getting off a cruise ship and directed to the local shops handmade goods really mass produced by little children somewhere

speaking of upholstery i wanted to thank for featuring a before and after of my boston townhouse living room project on their website today
this was a project that included several upholstered pieces
the sofa was a for baker furniture with fabric both to the trade the arm chairs were mitchell gold bob williams retail with a robert allen velvet to the trade and the side chairs were restoration hardware in their own velvet all retail
i point this out because i think its a good lesson in using varied resources to achieve the best results on a project
retail store furniture can often be covered in customers own fabric or col customers own leather so never hesitate to ask
it may be more expensive but to get exactly what you want its worth it

the story of a suitable boy is about a mothers search for a suitable bridegroom for her daughter marriage

my newest collection is appropriately named the express yourself series
this collection comes from deep within my imagination my love of art personal and the need to become a better and happier person

most of the new sentiments in this series are my own original thoughts and feelings
they are meant to be and encouraging to those that need to believe in themselves more something i have always struggled with

i was so happy when i identified it anything seemed possible
it even seemed that someday i might wake up and see coming forward from the room into the frame of that doorway which is always in my mind now a child a girl one whom i will at once without the shadow of a doubt
however when i read that quote to john just now he snorted and i must say that in view of earlier comments about certainty that without the shadow of a doubt possibly has an ironic ring
i tell all this not to elicit pity but to illustrate why even the years i spent living free and following my passions and sleeping and eating exactly when i felt like it were also filled with pain and depression and a very real sense that the world want me around to sully its reputation
the world told me that i was a leech and a sinner and that my who is perhaps the gentlest person in the world should be locked up somewhere
i heard subtle and messages coming from everywhere saying i have been born
my suicidal came not from the sense that i wanted to die but from the sense that i did not deserve to live

a couple of years ago while searching for comforting words to offer a friend i examined that saying more closely
i asked myself so what if someone is strong enough to endure does that knowledge or belief really make it easier does it take away the pain does that mean that stronger people are destined to endure more difficult trials simply because they are stronger how is that fair who would want to be stronger if only to endure more pain suddenly this saying meant to bring comfort seemed to be doing the opposite

in other words the exchange will not necessarily be limited to a minority of the population potentially of the population not covered by or could get access to the exchange and thus the public option
however as pointed out what this means is that the progressive community will need to mount an employer campaign to move people onto the exchange and then onto the public option
luckily the american labor movement knows how to do employer campaigns thats what justice for janitors was all about and thus has the potential to push their own employers to move their health care plan onto the exchange and the public option through the normal process of contract negotiation potentially dramatically improving the of unionized firms against their competitors
the issue as shown elsewhere is that this will require a fair split between workers and management of the labor savings this involves

to be perfectly honest readers there really is no good reason to cheat
it is an action performed by people who clearly care about the people they could hurt
if you love someone are truly happy with them then you would never feel the need to go elsewhere
if you feel yourself drifting towards other partners you need to reevaluate your relationship because the chances are you be in it anymore
so the next time you feel the urge to cheat assess the ramifications and decide if its really worth it

this concert just us matador singers though

we sang along with the which was really cool
we sang requiem which was really super awesome
the extra rehearsals leading up to the concert were awful but i really enjoyed the performance itself
a short time after entering the museum i stopped under a recreation of a tree with several other visitors of various racial and age groups to watch a short video that showed numerous examples of violence against african americans while three a man a woman and a child stood in the display case next to me in ku klux outfits
i had seen these types of films before but not in this context
i was honestly moved almost to tears by the sadness and disgust that i felt as i watched the video and am convinced that the only reason i shed any tears was because i was equally angry that people can be so vile and hateful because of a persons skin color
as the video ended i looked around at the rest of the crowd and recognized varied looks of sadness anger and
after taking a moment to compose myself i turned my attention to the aforementioned display and was moved to sadness and anger all over again
the display talked about the role of women men and children in white organizations like the and i found it quite fitting that this trio that looked like a family stands together looking out at the tree seeing as i learned about how were family social gatherings
are you kidding me how messed up is that i guess i have been surprised since children have to learn to hate from somebody
why it be a family tradition to practice and celebrate violence

what makes this the most feminist film of the year is not just its portrayal of how faith infuses everything about her life and enriches her friendships but how hard it is when she begins to lose that faith and her previous closeness to god
instead she begins to notice all the in her life the ministers wife who wants to correct her behavior or dress her husbands insistence on wifely submission her lack of other things that might fill the gap left by god and give her life meaning the emptiness of her promises of glory in exchange for obedience
at last a film about that can be feminist too

randomness is something that i am increasingly allowing in my work
this is not always easy because i tend to want to control the way my paint gets on the paper or canvas
i want to control the outcome but somewhere on the way i miss or discard a lot of great accidents that my materials might produce
as a way of forcing myself to allow randomness more frequently in my work i started with a new daily project making things out of random prompts
there is quite a challenge in this for me about half of the prompts i wrote are related to themes or materials that i almost always avoid because not good in them because i like them because i find them too difficult or just because i never thought of using them before
today is all about the part of writing the work you do before you write

let us assume that it can be fairly said that and religious rely on the faithful
can we say that in terms of the social life of a community that they give nothing in return in terms of the can one truly say that our children offering the holy sacrifice of the mass presiding at weddings and otherwise tending to the spiritual welfare of the people nothing certainly no catholic would claim such a thing i shall assume then that mr
meant that and religious are economic parasites only and hence the claim that if of the population were to devote their lives to christ in this way it would result in an economic nightmare because they give back nothing financially while relying on or even exploiting the faithful for any monetary income
they call him so he can spell it
and finally when it ultimately gets into operational service the may not be as advanced as other fighters out there but so what of it the tremendous experience and knowledge our scientists have gained from developing the will serve as a stepping stone to something even more advanced the next time around

we count the hours and figure that the bus is going to arrive in at around am
we asked before we bought the tickets what that would mean for us
we were assured that the bus would stop and wait at the station until light because there were lots of other passengers in the same situation
so we are on this awful bus hungry and thirst but too scared to put anything into our bodies
all i could do was hope that we crash and that if we did it be a painful death not being that dramatic
the bus stopped tons of times and people got off
by the time we got to our stop it was just the of us getting off and only a few other passengers left
we asked what time the bus was leaving we were told
its supposed to stay here till light it was leaving now for the border
lies all lies its am and we are in a dark bus station
not good
so got in the face of the driver and made him go talk to another bus driver
one that was actually staying until it got light
we looked in and there were about women chilling waiting for day
so we got on that bus and slept until about am

and he moved the ninth string from his harp crying out and saying glorious things are spoken of you city of god
the audience was struck by the many similarities in their perspectives says

the private face can be expressed as devotion full of intimacy and tenderness
and the public face said is manifested as compassion while dr
west commented that it can manifest as justice

from where i ascended the summit i would have to cover some distance to arrive at my perch
walking over the giant slab rock i noticed two large black birds hovering over me at some altitude while riding the current of wind keeping them aloft
they must have noticed me as they started to descend
the birds were alternately keeping station and descending to a lower plateau getting lower and closer to me
i wondered are these my spirit guides as i was waking over the crater top the birds were a constant bearing and collision course as if they intended to land on my shoulder or on the top of my head
as the birds were descending they started looking and
they were close enough for me to identify them and reminded me of edgar allen raven but much and not definitely not sitting on a perch in his study
i thought that they were ravens but i never in my life believed they were this big
their wingspan was wider than i was tall
being born and raised in the urban east coast i never before saw ravens and i never before saw any birds this big
and these big birds were coming closer and looking as i was crossing the open summit walking atop that big slab of a rock to my intended perch
were these my spirit guides i wondered aloud

the concept of keeping a secret identity in a digital age is a tough one
know how superman continues to do it
but maybe you just have to let go in order to have fun sometimes ex those who picked apart the plot of legacy and just enjoy the ride
once you can have a sense of humor and let go you open yourself up to more fun experiences
this goes for life in general
or you can just pretend everyone knows is the cape and they are just playing along to make him happy its also very funny that way

as david and turned a press conference around a boxing match into the precise opposite consternation and confusion reigned amongst the boxing elite
the key to the crunchy crisp skin is this secret ingredients
corn starch
what a valuable lesson i have learned from the living magazine this is such a simple roast chicken that anyone can prepare
all you need to do is to wash and clean the whole chicken believe it or not this is a task that i took a while to pick up the courage to do pat it real dry inside out and rub some butter all over the skin including under the skin
butter will help the chicken to brown evenly
the next thing is to rub a combination of salt pepper and corn starch all over the chicken including the cavity and of course under the skin to add to the meat
i like to add in some dried mixed herbs as i love the smell of the herbs when the chicken is roasting
it is perfectly all right to leave it out or you could do with some fresh rosemary finely chopped
i truss the chicken as i know how to do it plus i think it is not an absolute must
the last step is to place it in a roasting pan preferably one that comes with a rack to encourage even browning and leave it to the oven to the finish the job as it is not necessary to baste the chicken
in about an hours time you will be rewarded with a golden chicken not forgetting the inviting aroma of the roast chicken
i feel so proud for myself as i am very certain my could smell it and would probably think their must be a good cook
oh allah are you going to ask for happened

thank you and
you should in no circumstances become a double there are some instances where it is okay to double text though
if you have an blackberry or some other type of and lets face it thats everyone then double becomes okay
however you must send the texts straight after each other
this is okay because your texts are in the same thought and using as an instant service
if you wait for too long in between messages then it just seems lame and like you have been thinking about them and waiting for a response
the instructions on the say to sand in between coats which i skipped on the out of laziness but this time i did as instructed but just to the top of the dresser to make sure the finish was as smooth as possible
but emotionally in the middle of the night when i cant sleep do i regret passing on a book that someone else sold for a lot of money or that is now on the bestseller list well what do you think of course i regret it
first of all let me repeat that i am at a lost of words at how much i loved the show
i enjoyed it a lot and still have a hangover so
forgive me if i wont be able to give a detailed review
my question is
a normal baby is a handful
imagine a mother who probably is still struggling with alcohol addition trying to be reunited with her child that has how will she cope
discarded flyers litter the square beyond them by knots of the homeless roused from a night in a nearby doorway and the tide of working folk looking resolutely past it all as they rush to get to their job on time and try desperately to maintain their version of normality

thats it
my day at the huntington library art collections and botanical gardens
thanks for reading along and i hope you enjoyed the tour
i thoroughly enjoyed my visit and plan to go back soon
because the most important thing i learned on this day at the huntington is this what a luxury it is to have such a beautiful place so close to home
i realize that i take for granted all of the wonderful places i have nearby to see and experience and learn from
i take for granted that these places will still be there when i get around to going
do you do the same thing put off for another day the beauty and history thats in your own backyard tell me about a great place near you that put off for later
and tell me when will later be i hope for each of us later comes very soon
to be totally honest i think that album gets a rap by reviewers too
i was a cat that around listening to peoples instinctive travels
and the low end theory when they first dropped
i had to go back and retrace those albums after hearing later releases sorry still young and even though i missed out on a lot of magic i will always maintain that the love movement can stand up with their older work
well then i said vexed
why are you locking it
just a small little aside added much later seems to be eating the comments being left but please do leave them because i think getting them on notification
well seen a couple so far i have no idea going on with my though
in the early days of the and before the trains came in coney island a place for day
the two attractions were a the enormous resort hotels like the manhattan beach the brighton beach and the oriental where families would stay for their vacations by the sea
and several where people would come bet on horses which i conclude without making any value judgments explains the nearby presence of many wild saloons
and in the early days of coney island variety performers would entertain in these two kinds of the very genteel hotels and the very wild saloons
so stay tuned

she stood there frozen in her little black hipster outfit dollar skinny black jeans and dollar haircut caught stealing fruit from an old lady and not sure what to do or what was about to happen to her
i took the opportunity to continued on with my speech
those lemons belong to a little old lady
she planted that tree and comes out every morning to pick one to use in her tea
she gives them to her grandchildren and neighbors as gifts
and now you are breaking off half the tree so you can have some of her lemons
i am pretty sure she did not plant that tree for you to walk by today and it up

it lulls a bit in the third act so to speak
the death of phil davies more or less made me want to put the book down and be down with it
not all of the characters are winners either
of particular disappointment to me were the hero and heroine of the book
john who becomes the pirate jack is a french puppeteer heading to the caribbean to confront the uncle who stole his birthright
a nice enough back story but the execution of the character is lackluster and he seems like just another wooden hero not unlike the he uses in his trade
even his use of his puppeteer skills and his rise to a position of leadership and heroic piracy are too pedestrian for what is an otherwise astounding setting
his revenge quest which shifts to become a lovers quest has perhaps the most uninteresting ending read in a long long time
this is a shame since had powers not set up such a great story idea so rich with fantasy it would have been a great ending
under my feet
after the event
first off the weight measurements for the recipes are off in the first printing of this book
i usually weigh my ingredients thought that the measurements looked a little off but gave the book the benefit of the doubt and made the lemon cookies per the instructions
my cookies ended up spreading all over the baking sheet and looked nothing like the cookies from the store
later i found out that there was errata for the book
i understand that things happen and many books have a small number of errata
however this one seemed to have more than normal and the mistakes are big ones
i mean if the weight measurements are off then it means that every recipe is off
if you have a first printing please do yourself a favor and the errata here before making anything in this book
i have been told that the next printing of the book will have this mistakes fixed and amazon is even sending me a copy free of charge
i have been pondering and writing down some habits i would like to work on to aid in keeping me healthy

the thing most people understand is just how much the chaotic environment can degrade network speed
for people who care to test their cellular network speeds of to appear reasonable if somewhat disappointing
after all thats only of the capability of a network
unfortunately the reality is that a combination of factors can combine to degrade network performance to speeds closer to of the capability
interference and noise introduce errors which in turn force the network to use less efficient modulation schemes and can drastically reduce the network speed
an accurate test of network speed will reflect this reality
however the book is really written for younger children than the laura audience

a lot of people are fuming over spoilers released on the but in reality most of the leaked information is common knowledge to anyone who has seen the prerequisite films and i do recommend that you see these films before watching the as the film makes many references back to circumstances in those movies and not seeing them could leave you a little lost
if you have not seen these films does make a few spoken mentions of the important details but if not paying attention well then it just to be you

when jill asked us to raise katie in her absence jenny and i need to think it over
we looked at each other and we just knew that there was no other choice
we had known katie since the day she was born and she was already like an extension of our family
jill told us there was nobody else in the world she would trust to give katie the kind of love she deserved the kind of love she would need to survive her loss
you cant fix a heart thats broken like that
you just have to be there and let her live through it and let her know that there and that shell always be safe and loved
one of the hardest things in the world is to watch a child you love suffer through something you cant fix and we were terrified that we be able to do it

you may start out with a goal and a plan for your community
things may change as your community members evolve their relationships
however members determine how the conversation and the community develop and grow or die
since one of the main principles of community is that the community is in charge you may need to hold the reins very loosely
remember a mob is also a type of community
online passions can spike instantly and people have the tools to express themselves immediately
see a good example of what can happen on the influential
michael provoked an angry response when he questioned a journalist on a video resulting in a mob of angry people wishing him ill on the social site
depending on your community and how it evolves you may need to worry about mob rule
anonymous commenting is one of the ways social media can get out of control
we classify the people who comment on a post as a form of community although others disagree
the posters often comment on each others posts and things can get out of hand and way off topic
what is your responsibility in this case if you are too in ensuring posts are and polite users can revolt or simply leave

this is what zen buddhism speaks of in its emphasis on its not about choosing one pole over the other but in that seeing the world in terms of pairs of opposites is not a helpful viewpoint or skillful means that this is a relative choice and that looking directly into the nature of everything perceiving the whole allows us to see that these are arbitrary distinctions that we make and that we have a choice about whether we buy into them or whether we choose to work to bring the poles together in ourselves and thus in the world

its amazing how much a seemingly splendid line can be improved by boiling it down or completely rephrasing

she pushes the guys off at first but then shes she cant stop them or get away and they finger her and shove their into her mouth and her right there on the train car
and she makes a show of resisting which you know is part of why i find it kind of disturbing but its also pretty obvious that shes coming by the end and i turn me on i finished
and you had very casually said have to check them out sometime and that was the last we ever said about it
since id been tested and had a rabid reading habit of my own that allowed me to devour books in a very short time i was very advanced for being only years old
the school even said that if id had a better grasp of mathematics that they would have considered having me skip kindergarten and perhaps even st grade because i was already reading on a rd grade level
but my poor math skills kept me back and i hated the first day of kindergarten because it was nothing but recess all day
i was there to learn by god and all the playing was so boring and i get over the other classmates who would cry and whine and need to be restrained as their parents left each day they realize that this was where you could learn more and be away from your parents and be who you wanted to be

shes always been really positive but her time in hospital really showed me just how much
no matter how much the nurses pricked and probed her with needles got her up walking when she was weak or woke her during the night to take blood pressure she never once complained
instead she thanked them told them i know how you keep going working such long hours and that they were great

we have had a week let me tell you my sweet has been sick since tuesday with a high fever and what that doctor first thought to be a bladder infection
when i say high fever i mean high and i could not get it below
thursday night she was so sick i had thought about just going to the
we made it through the night and to the doctor on friday
she was in so much pain she would not let me touch her
as soon as the doctor saw her he told me she needed to be admitted
the bladder infection turned to out to be a kidney infection
it is so hard when your husband is away you have two kids in school are planning to have a garage sale the next morning your daughter is having friends over to spend the night and then you are told you need to take your daughter to the hospital minutes away i do not know what i would have done without a cell phone the ability to text and a group of friends who jumped in and helped with the kids on friday after school
the garage sale and did not happen and my daughter was not happy about that
i think i reached my text limit with her trying to explain why the and garage sale would not happen while sitting outside the ultrasound room waiting for to come out
also in advance going to say thank you dad for forcing me to think through every single inclusion of a wacky or
i want someone to be immersed in reading my book and then one completely piece of implausible science throws them back out

the sarcastic voice
and the that stand silenced before the almighty father include the voices of the restless conscience
in his first epistle st john says whenever our heart condemns us god is greater than our heart and he knows everything
so whenever we reproach ourselves for our unkindness our short temper our foolishness and and laziness for not being better parents better spouses better friends better at our jobs for not making more progress in our arts hobbies and fields of study for not being richer or fitter or more powerful or john tells us that god sees all this far more clearly and extensively than we do
and that when our conscience just wont shut up god who is greater than our conscience can silence it
the question can i forgive myself can be an agonizing one

peace is not just when the war is over and the armies are
peace is the condition of being secure in ones property and person of being able to perform ones routine activities without fear of violence
the last century and a half has allowed us to forget how rare and precious real peace is
the typical condition of mankind before the nineteenth century was to live in brutality and fear
men had to be armed and eternally vigilant to attain peace slaves serfs and women could not hope for it without the protection of a rough man ready to do violence on their behalf
i thought i was the only one who sees the new black panther party as nothing more than a bunch of a
trying to get gullible people to react violently
newton foundation of the original panthers are denouncing them all of these hate groups have agents their organizations

only a sucker would fall for the
the panthers and other real positive black movements were destroyed by gay edgar hoover
even sellout blacks were used by the to infiltrate and destroy the movement
think for second that this agenda has ended

and here is what i believe barnes may have been after a visage a physiognomy made from symbolic decorative arts items suggestively arranged to resemble a face
normally this consists of candlesticks for eyes and vessels for a mouth and occasionally a nose and mouth
thus the concept of the of art at the barnes foundation or a pervasive mirror if you will
essentially barnes was creating the suggestion of a face on the very surface which a centralized viewer would be standing in front of
and the items vary according to which direction the symbolic connection is to go
for example in gallery on the south wall see image above a teapot is placed it both formally references the reflection on the lake in the gauguin painting above it as well as symbolizes a carrying and possible pouring out or out of of knowledge wisdom or
conversely in gallery east wall the central vessel mouth if you will is a host box for holding the symbol of body for communion
of course it references the painting above a of a vision of the holy by el
but it also symbolizes the emptiness which it is of a soul waiting and imploring for the holiness of god to fill them it is a vessel in waiting in limbo in anticipation along with the saint seen in prayer receiving a vision
as you prepare your home for an open house you should make the decor as tasteful and as possible
a conservative buyer might be offended by any liberal books or items you have on display

try to make it broadly appealing instead of narrowly focused on those just like yourself
if your neighborhood is under the rule of terror by a gang like howard boys and you do the right thing and one or two or more you would get either life in prison or the death penalty
and if white any prison time for killing blacks equates to the death penalty
either get tortured and beaten to death or get tortured and turned into a until you die of aids
heck if white you have to have harmed a black in order to suffer the aforementioned ends
just being white is enough

i generally do that anyway but in the last few years i think i may have drifted into thought patterns for understandable but reasons
the electricity in my area shut down in the morning and was off all day so we huddled under blankets and i read a book
our poor dogs were freezing outside
we had to fortify their shelters as best as we could against the wind and gave them some old carpets and blankets to burrow under

i think generally life can be divided into cycles or phases
i call them the up cycle and the down cycle
the up cycle is basically when i feel the gods are smiling down on me
everything fits
everything feels great

you get the idea
the down cycle is like a rainy day that never ends
i can echo is too much unnecessary

i wish they had a real demo out because it looks like it hits an amazing note of simplicity married to complexity that these sorts of games really need
it has a beautiful clean interface from the screens and seen that just looks like a joy to observe while pretending it is a display on the deck of your command carrier
its unfortunately vague on a lot of specifics because you know its a so you things
its really hard to pin these sorts of games down without actually spend an hour or twenty with them so that does make me pause

today was an ordinary day by standards
both children were sick
the house is a bit messy
the dishes are bathing in the day
the groceries have been haphazardly shelved in the pantry
clothes for a sale tomorrow yet to be tagged
the house is full of the fresh smell of spring
the driveway is gallery to masterpieces
amid all this seemingly ordinary i thank my god for the extraordinary

its all quite amazing
i have been blessed beyond what i truly expected today
i awoke to sickness spilling out from two little rooms
coughs and making way for a day i knew would be spent at the doctors office
we made our way through the construction and midday traffic
we popped in and out of stores to gather the and sure to stifle further illness
we arrived home
word is ever quite as sweet as home to a weary and tired soul
the mere sight as we turn down our street makes my heart leap for the peace of my home

pessimism of the intellect is how an intelligent person colors their glasses they see the world as it is
as studies that are more likely to think critically and be live longer
false hopes keeps many people alive literally
yet the turn of the gleeful pessimism who makes these faults not seem like faults seems like the most perverse move indeed it brings the hope to the strange place

as i look more and more into alternative families i do wonder sometimes about the displacement of the dad
for example i know a guy who is the father to a baby for two
a straight guy and the one was his best friend so he donated his for her
the kid knows him but he is definitely known as more of a super uncle
super uncle jim
since jim is a poet and has an unstable living situation this is a great arrangement for him
he sees the kid when he wants and gets to be a dad on the side
but what about the gay men who do not want to be dads on the side sure they can adopt or have their own kids via surrogate but i think a lot of times they get left out of the alternative family building process because chicks still own their even though the government often thinks they own them but thats a subject for another post by another
thats when i thought nothing is as it seems

i can see many actresses just over playing the role as the role does lend itself to the insanity
yet while she does have her wild moments there are touches of the subtle woven throughout
looking back on how she played some of the scenes there is such a genius in every movement
as carl is also excellent as the young psychologist trying to flesh out his ideas and most importantly figure out the best way to help people
as freud rounds out the awesome trio
i think the weakest of the three but only because not given as much time to develop as a character

we see aunts for example from both north and south who want to rule over their nephews and nieces
there is a generation probably those fifty and up who cannot for one minute put the civil war behind them and there is a generation especially those in their twenties and late teens who quite understand why it still has to be such a big deal like to see some change or progress at least
definitely still tension between north and south as well
our is a yankee visiting a southern town
his yankee aunt warns him throughout not to be too influenced by the southerners
she want him to like or love his travels too much
and the people of the town especially the of the town find it hard to open up with any yankee no matter how seemingly charming

lets just say that the and almost every single person in the novel does not believe in equality of the races and most certainly does not believe that they should have the right to vote or hold any sort of political office
social class also plays a role in this one
got the tension between people who once had money but now only have class manners and pride
and the newly rich who many view as having no class and low morals

when this is complete in a couple of months it will be put forward for full public consultation
that is the correct vehicle to seek public opinion about any changes to current policies concerning public open spaces and strategic gap
not a poll purporting to be about regeneration
that perhaps someone might be a tad concerned about the growing opposition to the plan

in the end though after going through the book twice i decided not to buy it at all

there are now books that are prime eligible compared to about in january
not all of those are in the select program but for simplicity sake lets say the number of books eligible for a select free run has doubled since the first of the year and posit that there are now twice as many books being offered free as there were then

but thats not what were seeing
were seeing it take the same number of to hit a given rank even though there are almost twice as many books available
