I never liked coffee when I was younger. Didn’t really have much use for the stuff. It kind of made me an anomaly in my family. My parents and grandparents drank coffee by the gallon. Perked at first, later drip brewed, always with milk or, if need be, non-dairy creamer.
One of the problems we face as Lay Disciples of Jesus, is that the modern church is not structured to properly assist lay people, who are not part of the “religious establishment”, to follow the personal path of discipleship the Lord is calling them to follow. The modern church establishment does not expect lay people to enter into such individual callings. The establishment expects that any one who has such a call to either enter a seminary to become a priest, deacon, or minister or to join some religious order. It is difficult to overcome the prejudices of the past that have placed lay Christians as passive , un-empowered, servants of the clergy, having no understanding of things spiritual.

It saddens me to see a beautiful life art-form and science-of-life misunderstood and misinterpreted. But I guess that is what we humans tend to do. If we are a people that can crucify a holy man, we can also easily throw out the proverbial baby with the bathwater.

Guy/Gal #1: Eats it up. Their self-worth and ego suddenly implodes to the size of the Atlantic Ocean when other attractive members of the opposite sex are around and are openly flirting with them in front of their partners. Their self-worth solely depends on OTHERS APPROVAL and not their partners. They are not secure in their committed relationships and obviously feel a lacking somewhere within. They believe b/c of that LACK that at any given time their partner will leave or lose interest. As a result, they use others outside of the relationship as a way to fill or “correct” what they feel they are lacking and hope that this will seal some sort of idea in their partners mind that they are super desirable with a boatload of options.

I’ve always made fun of those people who dress their dogs up, cook them special meals, and take them to the vet to get their teeth brushed. I’m a hypocrite. Just weeks ago I resorted to a canine version of “bootie shorts” with Depends stuck in them to keep my two dogs from peeing on my couch, my pool table leg, my rug…and anything else that might seem like an appealing urinal for these mutts. If it weren’t for my daughter Charli’s strong attachments to Max and D’Marcus, I’d have blessed two other lucky families with an old, grouchy, neurotic Schnauzer and a sweet, adorable, dumb-as-a-rock long-haired doxie. They are making me crazy.

I was scrabbling around for inspiration (as mentioned earlier: stress = not good for my drawing) and decided to do an expansion on an unnamed character that I had drawn some 2 years ago in my then-sketchbook; a moleskine of about A6 size. The earlier image can be found below and I thought it nice to contribute it as it shows a reasonably remarkable change in style and skill (I think). In the original I added the title “War and Peace” to the novel the guy was reading in order to show that he may be in the gutter, but he’s trying to better himself through literature.
Last Monday (the 7th) I had an "Academic Planning Meeting" with my Field Liaison, the Director of the MSW program, and the Director of Practicum. Essentially my liaison is concerned about me not being able to pass my practicum due to problems that have been occurring over the course of the year. I was initially at the middle school, but after about a month and a half I was transferred to the high school due to a lot of issues with my field instructor (supervisor). Since going to the high school I feel like it's been one issue after another. I got really low ratings on my evaluation at the end of first semester, and in my opinion they were largely in part to my supervisor not providing supervision like we were supposed to have each week. Plus my supervisor continues to believe that I am a clinical level student, but I'm a foundation level student. The difference between the two is that the foundation year is the first year of the 2 year program. Everyone takes identical classes and it's kind of like taking general education classes...except they are specific social work classes. The second year of the program is where you decide between the clinical track or the administration track, and your classes and practicum is based on which track you take. So the clinical track is the track that I plan to take next year. My supervisor expects me to be at the level of a clinical student, despite that I'm still in my foundation year. This has caused a lot of problems in terms of expectations and experience because I'm just not at the place my supervisor thinks I need to be. Needless to say this meeting was a brainstorming session to come up with ways to make sure I pass. The outcome ended up being (in my opinion) telling me to just do what I have to do in order to pass. We've established that I have no desire to be a school social worker, so I think that's the biggest problem that my supervisor has with me...that I don't have a passion to be a school social worker. My passion is working with the military population and people with PTSD and mental health disorders. Hell I even loved my job working in foster care...but I despise being in the school setting. I disagree with the policies, I don't feel it's a helpful environment, and I just plain don't like it. Maybe it's the district, maybe it's me....who knows, it's just not my cup of tea.

The two outside bars with the signs of infinity represent the eight Metis Settlements land areas and keep the infinity sign of Louis Riel’s Metis flag. The circle of life in the centre reflects the joining of two cultures, the red symbolizes our Native ancestry. The white represents our French and Scottish ancestry. The brown is our new vibrant Metis culture. Within the circle two peoples join hands and invite ours into the circle with their extended hands. The bottom half has the letter “M” for Metis. historyonline.msgc.ca/

TrekMovie was first in reporting that Benedict Cumberbatch had joined the Star Trek sequel cast, to play a villain (originally a role offered to Benecio del Toro). A few outlets have also reported (including today’s AICN) that this villain was Trek’s most famous bad guy – the exiled Eugenics War leader Khan Noonien Singh (originally played by Ricardo Montalban). TrekMovie has also confirmed this with a number of sources so we no longer consider it to be a rumor.

My husband and I were reflecting on this past year. We moved to another state, again. We started over in a place we knew nothing about. We get by on less than we ever had. We have given up things we thought we needed. And we have never been happier. Our laughs bellow from deep within, the kind of happiness that pours over. We talk about our hopes and our dreams, and how what we thought was unattainable is in fact a reality. We listen more, wait patiently (most of the time), and have seen our faith grow tenfold.

Cicero explained in detail the strange events plaguing his household over the past few days, which I will summarise for you here. On the Nones of March, his papers were scattered all over his house, like the shattered remnants of the Pompeian forces, dispersed after the Civil War. Only a few papers were too badly damaged to be repaired, those containing notes on Sextus Roscius (Cicero’s first major defence.) A few days later, a statue of the Goddess Minerva was stolen from his house; similar to how Verres (a successful prosecution for Cicero) had pilfered whatever he pleased from his unfortunate Sicilian people. Finally, and here being the crux of the matter, just this very day, a slave of Cicero’s was found dead, stabbed repeatedly in the sizable garden of the house (again representative of a case of Cicero’s, namely, this time Clodius killed on The Appian Way.) Someone was terrorising Cicero and they must have had help from the inside. I was on the case.
Luckily not all brewers are Brewdog and another Scottish brewery appears to be taking a far more appealing approach to the marketing of their quality offer.

The film starts out innocently enough: Kenji is a math-genius and programmer for the online virtual world of OZ. He is offered a proposition by his co-worker, Natsuki, to spend the weekend at her family reunion shadowing as her fiance. Reason being is that Natsuki’s grandmother is turning 90, and she promised to show off her fiancé to prove that she’s got a grasp on her life. Kenji blindly accepts the offer, having had a crush on Natsuki for a long time now.

Mengele also tested drugs that were the direct experimental subjects of the US Navy’s Project CHATTER. Project CHATTER was a Navy program that began in the fall of 1947. Allegedly, responding to reports of “amazing results” achieved by the Soviets in using “truth drugs,” the program focused on the identification and testing of drugs for use in interrogations and in the recruitment of agents. The research included laboratory experiments on animals and unwitting human subjects involving Anabasis aphylla, scopolamine, and mescaline in order to determine their speech-inducing qualities.

The agencies both have automated underwriting systems and these systems are initially run by the processor to see what the minimum documentation is and then anything questionable must be documented also. The underwriter then uses their expertise to further analyze the file, the documentation and the overall risk factor that may exist. The automated underwriting systems spit out minimum documentation requirements from what has been entered into the system. It is a machine so it cannot see with the human eye and only uses information it has been given by the human; therefore, there is room for error. When something changes after it is documented; (income, assets, liabilities, after being verified) the automated underwriting system must be changed along with the new information and new underwriting requirements review yet again. As with any process; sometimes this has not been done properly; therefore, underwriting decisions can be made that are not actually the true story as it has been verified. These systems are governed by humans and as we all know humans make mistakes and even though there are explicit guidelines that should be followed; there are still errors made that can change the approved status to a declined status. Mortgage Underwriters and Processors have decided that it is best to fully document a file and then there are less risk and more prudent analysis done.

I have previously typed a lot of work and it hasn’t gone any quicker (due to bells and whistles of formatting) but it is easily readable. So if your handwriting is bad this is a good option. Downside is if you type it you have to print it (and bind/secure).

Where is the dignity in that? It is understandable that people have to look for work to feed their family. But going abroad just to find decent work? There is something wrong with this picture. People typically go abroad to invest in business enterprises, not work for a marginal living. Filipinos want to be near their family members, but the fact that many of them have to travel halfway around the globe just to find a decent job that pays decent salary is something that has to be addressed by the Philippine authorities.
The hybrid nature of “Umbrella” may not be terribly obvious on a first listen, but it includes a fair number of disparate elements. It is a dance song set to a rock backbeat with Caribbean-accented R&B vocals and a rap intro. The arrangement is tight. The lyrics are straightforward, and why shouldn’t they be, when there are so few great songs about fidelity?

I first want to take a look at Investor’s Intelligence. Over time this has proven to be one of the better gauges of sentiment that I have seen. Here is a look over the past 7 years. The keys to look for when looking for a major top are bulls at less than 20% and bull/bear ratios over 2.50 for at least a few weeks. While one shouldn’t rely on this indicator alone it has been quite useful. I want to start with mid-2007 and work forward. The market made an initial peak in July 2007 before a nasty correction into August. The bull/bear ratio was over 2.50 for close to 3 months straight and bearish readings were below 20%. In October 2007 the bull/bear ratio had a big two week spike and bulls moved below 20% once again. That ended up being the top of the bull run from March 2003-October 2007. After the peak sentiment fell off a cliff and never really recovered until late-2009. The bull/bear ratio spent about 2 months up near 3.00 and bearish readings were clearly under 20%. The market then saw a correction in January 2010 of 8% or so. Now look to April 2010 ahead of the “flash crash”. Bull/bear readings were up near 3.00 and bearish sentiment was under 20%. Now look at the peak in April 2011. The bull/bear ratio was over 2.50 for the better part of 6 months before that high and actually spiked up to 3.00-3.50 right before the peak. At that time bearish sentiment was once again under 20%. Now look at where we are today. Last week was the first time since April 2011 that the bull/bear ratio came close to 2.50 and bearish sentiment is still 21.5%. These are not the kind of numbers one would expect near a major market peak with regard to sentiment.

Also, be prepared to abandon your stroller in a sea of stroller parking several times throughout the day. It's a great idea to make your stroller easily identifiable with ribbon, balloons, cover with a poncho when you park, whatever you can think of to help make yours stand out in the sea of strollers. Do mark it though, mistakes happen and if someone grabs your stroller by mistake it would be nice if they can call your cell phone.

A viewer want to know how to get over an infatuation. I guess what you’re saying is an infatuation that wasn’t reciprocated meaning you had a crush on someone and they didn’t feel the same way and that’s hard, and other people might look at you like uhhh..”What’s your problem? Get over it, it’s no big deal.” Yeah it wasn’t a relationship but still there’s feeling involved, you had a feeling for this person, you’re interested, that person didn’t reciprocated in anyway.

On days like this I tend to get sad. Really, really sad. As happy as I am. As proud of her, as much as I adore her. I grieve the yesterdays. I miss what was and know that it will never be again. I was not a Mother who "missed it" as so many people I know claim. I was there. I was paying attention. But it was still too short! Those mornings of snuggling her on my chest. Those days of carrying her in my arms, of chasing her as she toddled ahead of me...they were just too short. And if I let myself I can sob away the hours just missing those moments. So, I must find solace....and I do...in two things:

There's something weird going on at our house right now. I don't know if it's someone pulling a prank and trying to be funny or what. There's some ridiculously immature kids around here, that's for sure. So, it wouldn't surprise me one bit. But, we're doing a whole bunch of yard work and we have soakers and 2 sprinklers set up to water the sod on our front&side hills. One of the sprinklers is hooked up to a faucet in our garage, and the other sprinkler is hooked up to the faucet on the other side of the house. We turn them off any time we leave the house. Well, the past two time that Charlie has had a volleyball game, we have come home to the side sprinkler turned on. Both times the faucet is BARELY turned. Tonight we came home and along with our sprinkler on, our mail was on our front porch. Our mail lady NEVER puts in on the front porch. Even if we have a package. It's something small that's going on, but it sure is irritating and completely inconsiderate. That's money going right down the drain.

L: But there IS evidence that santa does not exist … It’s called your parents putting gifts under the tree. There is yet to be any evidence found for the nonexistence of God. Comparing God to Santa Claus is a hasty generalization. Just because you can dismiss something does not make it true. I’m sure you are well aware of the great lack of knowledge the human race possesses. You should know better than to disregard a possibility because it lacks evidence. I’m confused on why you are so confident to determine God cannot exist. It’s a very sensible theory with the knowledge the human race currently possesses, the claims it breaths is not illogical, just unproven. Your argument is too simple, it does not explain anything but the ignorance to look beyond the question at hand.

While the weekend relied on the hard work and co-operation of all NUTS members present, special credit must be given to NaSTA Co-ordinator Chris Leyland, and his assistant co-ordinator Kathryn Feavers, who have been working tirelessly since last year to put on the greatest NaSTA so far.

The pain in her abdomen feels like fire and knives, and she can almost imagine the organs punching deep fangs inside of her body, draining her of nutrients to feed their growth. She continues to cry and wriggle about, actually pulling one arm free and twisting into the grasp of the other captor. She suddenly grasps the person with both hands, and smoke curls up from under her hands, as milky fluid begins oozing from bulging, porous flesh in her palms and finger tips. The liquid eats at the pristine white of the person’s uniform, causing it to howl in pain as the milk makes contact with the bare skin beneath. The other uniformed being, unaware of the cause, wraps its arms around her and attempts to pull her off. One of the bulbous organs painfully detaches from her body like some sort of cephalopodan creature and attaches itself to the other guard’s arm, and another loud shriek fills the room as it pulls away from her.

I think most of the people who hold this view probably started with good intentions. At face value it sounds much friendlier, and supposedly this way no one’s feelings get hurt and the pressure is off. But who decided that for something to be true it had to be pleasant and accommodating to everyone? Regardless of any good intentions, there is a giant gaping hole in the logic behind making an absolute claim stating that there are no absolute claims. It also shows little knowledge of the world’s religions. Keller elaborates:

Here’s why: Anything you offer in the world, must live within yourself first. Otherwise you cannot give to the ‘outer’. You might think you can but then its based on a need for yourself. A need that you subconsciously feel the ‘outer’ should fulfill through your own expectation. At the end, you will be the disappointed one.
Närke Kaggen has an amazingly complex aroma: thick hunks of chewing tobacco, deep veins of ripe fruits. A great unabashedly Old World stout. Unrestrained but classic. Black Note (a blend of Bell's Expedition and Double Cream stouts) had a huge bourbon and vanilla nose, and rich sweet flavors of raisins, vanilla, as well as strange burnt rubber notes. Too much seems to be happening at once, but then it blends into a perfect subtle aftertaste.
I was recently invited to try out a few pairs of tights from We Love Colors, and I jumped at the chance since I've been wanting to order a pair for a while now. I remember going shopping for hosiery about a year ago and being SO frustrated. I wanted some awesome colourful tights, and I couldn't find ANY. I went to The Bay (sort of like Macy's for you US readers), and checked out their hosiery section (which is actually pretty huge). I expected I would find lots of options since they seem to have so many, but I was really, really, terribly disappointed. They carry Hue brand tights, which I was excited about because they come in lots of colors. I started looking through the rack for my size, but guess what? Nothing in my size. I asked an associate where the plus size hosiery was, and she directed me back to the Hue section. I told her I hadn't found anything there, and she showed me my size. In black and brown only. URGH! Big women want to wear color too!!! HELLO? Plus size women want more options than black and brown. There wasn't even any gray. :S
My cool, suave response was, "Um, I'm with her," nodding to my friend. I was freaked out! This was crazy!
(My sincere apologies if you are reading this in some language besides the Jargon it was written in. I guess translation programs do as well as they can, but I desperately hope that all the nuance of the points I am making and the colloquialisms of Galactic Jargon shine through as both blindingly intelligible and bulkily persuasive. This is the eternal hope when words from one form of life are made to fit into words from another. Understanding other people’s art faces this same challenge. Its sometimes as if we were receiving transmissions from a distant world, messages from an all too alien planet….)
The paper dragon is trying to sharpen its claws, putting on some muscle and learning how to fight. China now has hundreds of modern warplanes, a growing fleet of nearly-modern warships and modern equipment for many of its ground troops. But there are still a lot of corrupt officers, at all levels. It’s not just the stealing; it’s also the many officers who don’t make the extra effort. There’s also a lack of recent combat experience, which eliminates the possibility of getting the best officers promoted and worst ones killed off or pushed to the side.
So I asked – How can the Ordinariate help bring these great figures into a wider readership in the Catholic Church? The answer? Find out in the next post.
Once you figure out how to attach the ruffler foot to your machine, it’s actually relatively simple. The up-and-down motion of the needle drives a sharp bit of metal back and forth, causing fabric threaded through a particular part of the foot to bunch up. How much it bunches per stitch is controlled by a little screw; another little lever adjusts whether the gathering takes place on every stitch, or only once per so many stitches. This means you can technically use the foot for making pleats as well, and control your gathering ratio quite precisely. Fabric tension and stitch length also play a role.
The question on everyone’s mind has to be, why is this in black and white? My theory is that it is meant to be seen as if through a security camera, which, for the most part, you expect to be in black and white.
This is a very early quote from the piece, but it sets the tone throughout. You can see pretty clearly that his take is Amazon is totally at fault and publishers were doing little more than defending themselves. Interesting take, particularly considering Amazon was the victim in this case, the admitted target of the pricing scheme that publishers (allegedly) illegally colluded to put in place.
The book leaves you with the final question; what would you do if you could change the future? Would you make yourself happy or would you save the world?
P.J. Hoover and the Andrea Brown Literary Agency, Inc. are excited to announce the May release of P.J.'s debut young adult novel SOLSTICE, an intensely romantic story with an innovative mythological angle.

You know the saying: “Pregnant women are glowing.” You have also met some of those women who “Just love being pregnant.” Well, y’all never met me.
Also note worthy is the inclusion of Jon Favreau as Foggy Nelson, as Favreau would later go on to not only direct but appear in Marvel Studio’s first self-financed movie Iron Man, playing a different character (making him one of only a handful of actors to do so, the others being Ryan Reynolds, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, Ben Foster, Chris Evans, and technically, Mark Rufallo – see The Avengers).
Wow, I have no kids tonight and none in the morning. I never know what to do with myself when my son stays out for the night. This is only about the 3rd time in his 2 yrs that I have let him stay away from me. Everyone says it is good for him and good for me and that I should enjoy it and go out. Well I realized tonight that I am not sure what I should do with myself anymore. My husband is away so it's me and the dog and she isn't that much fun to hang out with. It is an odd feeling that I can just get up and leave the house if I want because the boy is not upstairs in bed.

It was also a tech nightmare. I created the blog on wordpress.org, which if you don’t know means that I created the blog from scratch. Every sidebar, every image, I had to essentially design and code myself. I’m amateurish at design and coding in the best of times. My strength is in my writing. That’s a huge lesson right there - PLAY TO YOUR STRENGTHS.
3. Shellac – We love glossy candy, but do you know how it gets that gloss? They’re often coated with shellac, a sticky substance derived from secretions of the female Kerria lacca, an insect native to Thailand. Food it’s found in: candy canes, jelly beans, candy corn, and other shiny candy.
Or maybe I didn’t even make the cut. Yeah, that sounds about right. Because I’ve got no rhythm, no soul, can’t dance or carry a tune, so I’m in props now.
It was an awful lot of hard work, the band as a whole had to push ourselves to be ready to record this record. We had a fantastic studio with Danny B at HVR studios helping us so much in the process of putting the album together. He was extremely patient and wanted to deliver a fantastic product. Also having Jason Hicks at Dark Visions art doing allot of work in the artwork and working with lyrics and myself to deliver the art work which he done a fantastic job for. Regarding new material we currently have a new single that is nearly complete. It’s just waiting for my vocals to be finished. We will then continue to write the second record and look to record in the winter.
And on such a Sunday in the fall, days before Ronald Reagan was to make his only campaign visit to an American college campus--choosing Tuscaloosa for its ardent reborn conservatism and Saturday church of football--we were talking about him. I blamed him for all the resurgent woes of neanderthal behavior: the burning of a cross on campus to protest a Black sorority, the dangling of the Stars and Bars from a house on Bryant Drive, the huge American flags flown from masts erected in the beds of passing pickup trucks--all responsible somehow for the moronic utterances by the students in my Introduction to American Literature class.

Mr Loureiro pointed out that the existence of an administrative act of the Ministry of Health authorizing the use of the word "zero" to indicate foods and beverages that have no substance highlights the thesis that the term is merely descriptive and therefore is not eligible for registration as a trade mark. This is indeed corroborated by Ordinance 27/1998 of the Health Surveillance Secretariat of the Ministry of Health, which regulates the nutritional information regarding supplements in the food industry – it provides in article 4.1.6 that the terms "free", "livre", "sem", "zero", "não contém" e "isento" can be widely used as to complete with the requirements in the Regulation for food—used for the labeling "does not contain".

Abdullah Gul needed a favor. It was February 5 of this year, and the Turkish foreign minister was fighting a push in the U.S. House of Representatives to recognize the Turkish murder of over one million Armenians during World War I. In past years the House had placated Turkey by dropping similar resolutions. But now, with the American-Turkish alliance weakened by the Iraq war, the resolution had found renewed support. Gul summoned representatives from the Anti-Defamation League and several other Jewish-American organizations to his room at the Willard Hotel in Washington. There he asked them, in essence, to perpetuate Turkey’s denial of genocide.
So the items that they put inside of the case varies from day to day and changes from morning to night. At the start of the day are usually biscotti and fancy muffins, through lunch time and dinner it's things like tarts and cookies and other sweeter stuff, and then late at night (some where around ten or eleven?) they bring out antipasto items.
And the pièce de résistance, slow cooked pork ramen. FRESH noodles, huge chunks of tender pork, a party-in-your-mouth array of veggie accoutrements (such as dried seaweed, fresh English peas, roasted Brussels sprouts leaves), and of course (my favorite) a soft-set egg. It was so delicious, and warmed me up on that chilly morning. Ok, so I ate it at like 10:15 am. The croissant from the hotel had been two hours ago and I'd trekked down to the Ferry building on a cold morning, so I had built up an appetite by the time the stand opened at 10am. If I had a second stomach, I'd eat another one.
These same activists are pressuring states on their voter registration and voter I.D. laws and are working hand-in-hand with the Justice Department to sue those states.

At the airport, it’s a crime to even joke about violating the safety and security of the others. If someone yelled threatening things in a clear rage, they would be arrested immediately. And the rates of people being victims of airplane violence are much lower than those of women as victims of sexual violence. Why take language seriously in one case and not the other?
An open picture of the card ... I used the same paper on the back to tie it all together, and again my "Priceless" stamp. The patterned paper is from the Cloud 9 Mat stack that I used for my Christmas card earlier this week.
In other words, Ehrman’s book is important to Americans only insofar as it can be taken to support the tenets of Christianity. Since it doesn’t, even by Ehrman’s admission, I’m a bit baffled at the attention it gets. I conclude that all the kerfuffle rests on this: Christians conflate the existence of a historical Jesus with the existence of a divine Jesus.

As a postscript to my last entry here at Cinedrome, I've just learned that Cinemark Holdings, Inc. is presenting one-night- only screenings of Wings this month as part of their Reel Classics series. There were two of them scheduled, but the first one (on May 2) was over before I knew about it. That leaves one more, on Wednesday, May 16. Go here on the Cinemark Web site and click on the Wings/Reel Classics box at the bottom of the page to see if there's a participating Cinemark theater near you. If there is, you'll find it well worth your while.

Just as vitamins and minerals are important to strengthen our immune system, so are fats and carbohydrates. So it is important that we include different types of food in our diet. However, whatever we do or eat should be in moderation as an excess of any thing upsets the balance of nutrients, exercise and rest required by our body.
Or consider Dix Handley (Sterling Hayden), one of the doomed thieves at the heart of John Huston's The Asphalt Jungle (1950). During the Great Depression, Dix's family lost control of their horse farm in Kentucky; Dix—who functions as the muscle for the heist masterminded by Erwin "Doc" Riedenschneider (Sam Jaffe)—sees this robbery as his ticket to buy back the farm and regain his lost livelihood. When the heist doesn't go as planned, however, a series of deceptions and double-crosses leads an injured Dix, towards the end of the film, to drive all the way down to that horse farm and eventually die, as horses surround hims dead body. Unlike Tourneur and Lang, Huston adopts a naturalistic style in his film; much of the film plays as cool-headed dissection of a heist gone wrong. Within that style, though, The Asphalt Jungle manages to lavish utmost attention on the desires that drive the various characters in this drama; we end up developing a genuine stake in seeing these characters succeed—a subversive feat regarding characters that, in real life, we might merely dismiss as mere lowlifes and hoodlums.

So, how am I going to relate this to writing? Well, guess what kind of creatures show up in Searcher? Yep, centipedes. (BIG centipedes.) I'm not saying those are my best scenes in the book or anything, but they certainly were fun to write. It's one of the joys of what we do. We take these poor characters and force them to face our fears for us. They may defeat them (Jetta cuts a centipede's head off) or fall to them, it doesn't matter. You can always tell when those obstacles come right from the author's past.
I was surprised that he did not connect this to G-d's showing to Moses from behind, but as the author admits, this collection of tales is a set of tarot cards, a shuffling of many themes he has already drawn upon before. So, perhaps in his other books over the past fifteen years, he forged such a link. The inconclusive, speculative style of his thought on the page perhaps lacks a drama that, as I have only read, he possessed in his vocal presence. Parts of this are in Latin or Old Irish, and while some is translated, some eludes those of us less educated than the Causabons or George Eliots of our degenerate century. Such, on the other hand, is the discipline that rewards the adept.

Opponents of raising the taxes that high-income households face often point to findings that high-income taxpayers respond to tax-rate increases by reporting less income to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as evidence that high marginal tax rates impose significant costs on the economy.

The Stylistics – 7000 Dollars And You
Her trip to India that week gave us the green light to head there free from any guilt that would have risen in watching her puzzle over the menu and then pretend to enjoy the food. Most times, I will admit (as she will make me after reading this), she does not mind accompanying us and filling her stomach with anything even remotely digestible to her palate. Still, being the considerate daughter and father that we are (here is where she will exclaim with a loud and sarcastic Oh!), we would rather enjoy this outing without having to watch her make sacrifices. (After all hasn’t she done enough?)
There’s plenty of room for both session beers and extreme beers to thrive, because they are so entirely different – they do not compete! That is the beauty and main raison d’etre of the Craft Beer Revolution: difference, variety, choice. It always has been, and I have been saying that for years, while other voices talked about quality, and smallness, and artisanal craftsmanship. Those things are great, but they are part of the variety that is the overarching theme.
I felt scared and confused and totally depressed. I don’t know how much the decision to decrease my hormones at that time had to do with my extreme black mood. I wasn’t suicidal, but I did warn Michael that I was going to work my way through all of this, and if I did get to be suicidal, I wanted him to do something to stop me.
I told him that he had no choice but to quit. Honestly I was more upset about the cigarettes. Marijuana is legal for medicinal use in CO and is growing in popularity as a "healing herb." I don't condone it, but I also realize that with it available on every other corner in dispensaries, that talking responsibility is the key.I tried to talk more about how he needs to be of legal age before he chooses ANY legal habit (drinking, smoking, weed) and that he also needs to have the means to support his own habit without stealing. He said he would get the cigarette butts left in Bryson's ash tray. He told me who he had smoked weed with and who had supplied the weed and the paraphernalia. He also said he had stolen some from Uncle P. I am not naive enough to assume I got the whole truth, but I know enough to change the options he has.
Sharing your story and feelings while hearing from others and connecting with women who understand what you are going through is a great way to building this invaluable support system. I think when you lose someone you love, there is always a part of you that is missing but I believe having this kind of connection and support can also help you heal.

Speaking back in the summer, guitarist Brian Oblivion told online magazine, Spinner that the group was, “working on a hip-hop mixtape of the album– changing all the songs up and getting up-and-coming rappers, guys like Freddie Gibbs and Lil B. That’s going to be really exciting. We’re dealing with a lot of really bizarre managers and interesting personalities.”

Instead, I went to a high-profile Chinese doctor, knowing that Chinese medicine is not fast. It aims to cure the causes, not to mask the immediate symptoms. He gave me Die Da Wan Hua oil to rub on the shoulder. I knew, if it worked at all, it might take months or a year. Within three weeks, the pain had gone. That was twenty years ago. Until this past December, the shoulder pain recurred only mildly maybe only twice a year for a few days, usually if I put too much pressure on it; even now, it is nowhere near as bad as it was in 1991 – maybe a tenth – and only sporadically.

To make the tart, simply place the almond meal, flax, rosemary and salt into a food processor and pulse until well mixed. While running the machine, drizzle the oil into the mixture, followed by the water. Simply divide the "dough" into two oiled tart dishes and press. Bake at 350 degrees for 15 minutes until golden. For the filling, I chose to layer brie, olive oil sauteed spinach and mushroom with shallot and white wine. Pile the toppings on your tart, and place in the oven until the cheese is melted.

The scary wee bollocks' have had a few go's at the big screen. I watched the most recent one last night...'Dead Silence' by James Wan the same fella who introduced us to the dubious pleasures of the Saw franchise! Wan uses those potent plot devices, the ventriloquist’s dummy(AAAARGH!) and an old nursery rhyme to piece together a gruesome tale of supernatural revenge. Unfortunately the cast are so supernaturally shit that it’s impossible to care about any of them. The dialogue is dire and cliched.."If you go looking for answers you just might find them!"(???)...."I'm not the same person you knew,a stroke will do that to a man"...No shit!!!
I was walking on Robson st and had no intention of going to MAC but then I saw the Liberty of London stand through the window and ran right in. I love this collection and the birdy packaging. I went to MAC twice in one day to complete my haul and the same MA was laughing how she didn't expect to see me back so soon. My bf was shaking his head at me and I was called the liberty of london girl by another MA. haha.
Would a Venus man look vaguely like a human? “Why not?” counters Mr. Campbell. “After all, the human form on Earth represents two billion years of experimental engineering on the part of nature. It is the best possible form to do the things it has to. There is every reason to suppose that life on Venus, or on any other planet, if it has developed to a high level, has taken human form. But this form would have to conform to the specific conditions of the planet.”

Normally, I would not look forward to teaching a course in summer. In fact, I try to avoid it so that I can catch up on research. However, this year a special opportunity was offered to me and I could not turn it down. For three weeks, I will be co-teaching a 3-credit course on Brewpub and Brewery Operations (HRIM-404) with a colleague from Hotel, Restaurant, and Institutional Management. The course has been offered in past years - always during our May intersession, but this is the first time I've been involved. The gentleman whose position I'm taking will be off to his daughter's wedding ... lucky me!
There’s no need to go into much detail about this place. The staff was nice and eager to serve. They were prompt and friendly. The salsa was fresh and tasty. Better than a lot that you find in KC. The atmosphere was glum. Décor is relegated to a massive lineup of plastic two liter and glass soda bottles. And piñatas. Ancient, dated-looking wood paneling consumes the dank space.
I would say she’s the most outstanding person in that video clip. As I said in my previous post, I don’t understand why I can’t recognize her face when all the team members are together in photos.

As we climbed into the elevator, a little girl, not more then 10 years old stood behind me clinging to a penguin pillow pet. She was pale, and looked weak. On top of her bald head was a multi-colored snow cap. Next to us, a mom pushed an extra large stroller. Her daughter looked about 6 or 7 and was sucking a pacifier. I heard the two moms exchange pleasantries "Where are you headed?" "We have a spinal tap and then another round of chemo today."
What do you think of that? Jesus does not say, "If you brother sins against you just forgive him" but "rebuke him!" In other words, you cannot just lay down and let them run rough-shod over you and everyone else! They need to know what they have done! Let's face it, we and a lot of other people are pretty dense, and unless the offender is awakened to their offense they will go merrily on hurting and offending yet more!
your library and information management friends and colleagues on Thursday,
For several months now, the message from my soul kept resounding, "Let go." And yet that part of me--the part that has no fear, has not been running the show. And although I was often aware of this peaceful presence inside of me in the background, I let my mind and emotions dictate my actions and responses because they told me that I needed to resist the doubts within and hang on tightly with all my strength to what I am "supposed" to know. I had been taught that this is what faith is. I am now learning by finally heeding to the voice within to "let go", what faith really means.

When I first read Three Cups of Tea in 2008, it was one of the most inspirational and logical concepts I had ever come across: fighting extremism from a young age with a fair and balanced education. Although it’s a bit dense for entertainment, Three Cups of Tea promotes a simple, yet revolutionary “big idea”: it all starts with education.
Get off your butts and FIGHT for your country, Americans. FIGHT for the vision of America handed down to us by our founders that made this country the greatest in the history of the world. If you keep sitting on your butts thinking that others will do all the fighting for you, you will wake up one day and wonder what the hell happened.
I wanted to share some yummy desserts/snacks I made last night that were super easy. They are both valentine themed so it was fun. Going to Walmart to find this stuff on the other hand was not. I ended up having to go to Walgreens because Walmart was pretty much out of anything Valentine related. Note to self: don't go to Walmart on Valentine's day because everyone in their mom is there too. I couldn't even get down the aisles.
Carl approach is to record the lecture in advance then ask students to view the lecture before the time table slot. Getting them to do this can be problematic but he encourages them to watch it by asking them to write 3 questions relating to the lecture. They also need to jot down when in the lecture (the timeslot) the questions arise. Doing this not only ensures students watch but reflection on the questions is a learning process. As Carl explains “one of the most important things in learning is asking the right questions”. The questions are then uploaded to a community space (wiki, VLE etc.) and then there is a poll allowing students to select their top 10 questions. These questions are addressed in the face-to-face timetabled lecture slot.
They are trying to latch on to what in the U.S. has traditionally been a day for labor unions to achieve their goal.
Yo-Yo Ma is not someone I tend to think of as a creative person. He’s a performer, albeit a technically brilliant performer. But if you’ve heard as many recordings of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony as I have you’ll be well aware that a great performance involves a lot more than simply getting all the notes in the right order. Still what’s he doing in a book on creativity?
Favorite Detail: I love the delicate touch of flowers near the waist and shoulder.

We attended the Mauldin City Council meeting last night, to help a popular local businesswoman try and SAVE her business, which also happens to be an indispensable upstate treasure. Democracy in action! Well, we'll see how it goes.

I greeted her from my seat behind the library counter. Her face lit up. "Oh, I haven't seen you in a long time!" she said.
Over the course of my life, I’ve had dreams to write and produce music, travel the world and release a book, just to name a few. All of these dreams, and many others, have manifested into reality because I’ve learned how to move beyond dreaming to projecting.
I followed this recipe first because everything the author posts induces stomach growls, and second because her last instruction for the frosting was “bump the speed up to medium-high and beat the crap out of it.” Right on.

Day by day, my two sons and beautiful daughter continue their explorations of themselves, their worlds, and their lives. Sometimes, they explore in steps both gentle and tentative, sometimes in giant blind leaps both frightening and confidence-inducing. And while I pride myself in living in the present as much as I allow myself to, I do sometimes find myself cycling through rich memories of their younger years. Today, as I sit on a plane bound for Vancouver and dear friends, I am thinking about toy stores.
Hakam Bin Hisham entered the city, destroyed the entire city, completely took it upside down. He got the king and beheaded him publicly. Then he went to the sister, and he said to her: “Oh my sister, did I not respond to the call?” She said: “Are you the one who they call Hakam Bin Hisham?” He said: “My sister, I respond to the call of Allah. Come with me.”
Red Lion Hotel Along the Way
Sunday 12th June some of the cousins took us for a walk/hike to one of the many local areas of beauty (Seymour Valley). We wandered through trees and rocks, paddled in the icy river water and fought our way over the Lynn Canyon suspension bridge (there are several swinging bridges in the area including the rather more famous Capilano one). Then, after much playing for the younger members, it was off to the very pretty nearby Deep Cove for a Japanese meal (delicious – and not something we ever eat at home). Here on the Pacific coast, of course, Japanese food (along with most other Asian foods) is pretty much everyday fodder so it really was time we tried some more of it!
I've explained previously that I am from Wisconsin. I'm positive there are many people from my state with a natural sense of grace. An innate sense of class.
Second, it encourages teachers and librarians to organise activities and encourages them to think creatively about how they can use stories and books in the classroom. The Book Chook, for example, had a whole lot of suggestions. Our librarian was very busy and worked hard to get other staff on board. It really was a big focus for this week.

The deadly monotony of primitive music -- the endless repetition of a few notes and of a rhythmic pattern that beats against the brain with the regularity of the ancient torture of water drops falling on a man's skull -- paralyzes cognitive processes, obliterates awareness and disintegrates the mind. Such music produces a state of sensory deprivation, which -- as modern scientists are beginning to discover -- is caused by the absence or the monotony of sense stimuli....
Sabah BN has also been pushing for a royal commission of inquiry (RCI) into the illegal immigrant problem there for months now, with Cabinet ministers saying such an inquiry “will have little value” if announced after elections and that the issue puts their “political lives on the chopping block”.
From the video’s description:
“We hope that you will follow the currents of history, abandon the old practices of not allowing people to return to their country because of differences in political views, and use various effective means to permit us to return to China to visit,” said the letter.

Cesar Milan, the Dog Whisperer, frequently says that dogs do not wish to misbehave. They desire, and very deeply so, a good relationship with both their masters and other human beings. People are the same way. Dogs cannot be blamed for their poor training any more than people can choose their parents. Nobody wants banal conversation, they simply need to be shown a better way.

Wait - I thought we we supposed to be cutting spending. How come it's going up? This is something important to understand: When these people talk about "cuts" in military spending, they don't mean cuts, they mean smaller increases. That it won't go up as much as had been previously predicted. That's what they mean by "cuts."

Folks, it's high time we featured the work of this undisputed master of screwball masters. Milt -- if you don't already know -- is the goods. His comics are interchangeable with the definition of screwball: odd. zany, eccentric, and impulsively whimsical. His very line is screwy -- eccentric, spontaneous strokes that somehow create hilarious little drawings. A fellow screwball fan who knows his stuff recently coined the term "loose-scrawl cartooning" as a possible common element in screwball comics. I love that term, and certainly the comics of Milt Gross represent the apex of loose-scrawl cartooning.
And there were other incidents.
1984 Cauvard Corton-Charlemagne–We opened this to ‘pair’ with the cheese. Really, I just wanted to see how bad this one was going to be. Most critics would agree that 1984 was easily the worst year in Burgundy in the last 40 years. You can’t even find much information about it since it was so bad. Well, this wine was at best odd. It had a nose of an old Riesling. Problem was that it was a chardonnay. A dark color and absolutely no fruit to be found. It wasn’t repulsive, per se, but it was not good either. It was kind of like going out to dinner with just your brother/sister-in-law. It could be pleasant and even fun, but it would be weird and just not right on so many levels. Not rated.

A small number of our nobility mated with the Normans after 1066, we, the ordinary people, didn't, another small number of our nobility mated with the relatively small number of Huguenot nobility who we gave refuge to in the sixteenth century, we the ordinary people didn't. Some of our nobility may be mutts, which is probably why so few of them give a damn about the country now that they charge for access to their country seats (whenever didn't they?). However, the ordinary British people did not mix sexually with other races to any genetically significant degree until after the Empire Windrush incursion of 1948.

Each of us is gifted in different ways and we are each given a sword as part of our armor. These swords aren’t all alike because we aren’t alike. Some of us are gifted in scripture. Some can memorize it to amazing detail, divine it’s meaning for themselves and others. They can read a passage and immediately have clear understanding. Others are better at reading and studying in detail. Still others are best at delivering that word to others. Each sword looks different. They all have the purpose of protection and deliverance but they are all wielded in different ways.

Well, the last few months, Beckett has made even that sort of detached fanhood tough for Boston fans. Beckett, of course, was one of the key figures in Beergate, where pitchers -- Beckett prominent among them -- supposedly drank beer and ordered in chicken and played video games on days when they weren’t pitching. Whether this played any real role in the Red Sox late season collapse is beside the point. It looked bad.*

I do know I learned more from listening to this teacher on the way to lunch than I have from reading many educational blogs this past year. As well, I came away aching to continue learning from her; oh, I wish she shared digitally about her teaching and learning.

As you do get a little older, again you start looking at how you are aging. It becomes more important. If you don’t think that is true, look at all the money spent for cosmetic surgery. Beauty is only skin deep but health is not. Health is the entire body. Your body has systems to buffer the attacks placed against it by your choices and your environment. Imagine walking by an outdoor fire on a chilly day. You enjoy the warmth the fire gives, but a gust of wind blows the smoke directly into your face. You inhale a large breath of smoke and begin to cough. Little hairs in your wind pipe immediately move to push the smoke particles out of your lungs. You eventually quit coughing. How about cigarette smoke that is inhaled into your lungs many times a day? It’s amazing how long you can smoke before you are aware of the damage in your lungs.

Now here’s the amazing thing about that bubble. The staff of Senator Joe Lieberman and Representative Bart Stupak wanted to know whether the bubble was just due to “supply and demand”. Relying on the expertise of Frank Veneroso and Mike Masters (two experts on the commodities market), I was able to conclude beyond any doubt that it was a speculative bubble driven by a “buy and hold” strategy adopted by managers of pension funds. Hearings were held in Congress, with guys like Mike Masters testifying as well as representatives from the airlines and other industries.
“Nick,” he says with clarity and certainty, the certainty with which he can now pronounce the name “Nick” directly related to the clarity that it was actually Nick who pooed. Which is a total lie. If Nick did poo, he didn’t do it in our house. Nick is our neighbor across the street, and our son has taken a fondness to him of late. What makes it funnier is how he says “Nick” out of the corner of his binky-filled mouth. Picture Jerry Lewis with a cigar. “Nick. Nick pooed. Yeah, Nick.” The lie just keeps getting funnier.

VERDICT: I love a good stew, and this is a nice change from a more traditional beef stew. The sauce could have been a little thicker, but I'll simply add a bit more flour next time. The apple cider and sherry adds a lovely depth of flavor, and the crunch of the apple is really good with the pork. Yes, I'd make this again. All I need is that much needed rain and a roaring fire.

I have two blankets here that my mum made back in the late 60s early 70s and my sister and I are mystified because the granny square she has used is not the one she taught us to do. I will have to have a forage round her old chocolate boxes next Friday to see if I can find any old pattern books. I know my mum taught herself to crochet from a book and patiently showed my sister and I how to do it. She also taught us both to knit and I turned out to be pretty ok at it although I haven't done any f'rages. I like crochet because it grows quicker!
Clearly, your idea of exercise is going to the gym and doing “cardio” and running on the treadmill, riding a bike, doing whatever it is on the elliptical, etc. The fact that there is only 11 minutes of action does not surprise me in the least. But this shit is HARD. If you've done shit like wrestling, football, boxing, etc., you know why it can be so exhausting. Imagine working pretty much every muscle group to its maximum ability at the same time, while getting hit with a 2x4. Oh, and there's a decent chance at any given moment of action that your entire career that you've worked towards your entire life will end in a violent collision. It's fucking exhausting. Exerting everything at once to its max level is tiring, even after just a few seconds. And you ladies with your vaginae can shut up.

Gospel applications and speculations
Then I wanted to prove that my book can be as enjoyable as chick-lit books with big publishers. This is something that’s highly subjective, but it also means there’s room for making it happen, since having a big publisher only means a group of decision-making people liked your book. So yeah, the slow build of reviews and ratings are proving this second one true. My book is not for everyone (due to profanities, sarcasm and awkward Indian moments), but strangers who aren’t my friends have been shown to like it. So: done.

Growing up Blasian isn’t easy. As kids of the Black and Asian races, we sooner or later learn that we cannot choose one side; this is simply for the fact that we just never look like one or the other. Blasians have distinctly exotic facial features: the flared nose, medium to thick lips, chinky eyes, and tan skin… these all make us stand out from both races. Blacks think we’re too Asian to be black — Asians think we’re too black to be Asian. In the midst, we find that we can’t quite fit in to either side.

With the move to provide more educational content on the Web, a Student Web Accessibility Project was developed specifically to support accessibility of instructional resources on campus. The project had several components, including assessments of online instructional resources against Section 508 standards for Web accessibility, development of resources to support the creation of accessible online course materials, and assistance to developers in integrating accessibility into project planning and design of instructional sites. Findings were published in EDUCAUSE Quarterly in 2007.

'The Nettle Fairy of the Resistance' is a close translation, the film argued against the power of the large agro-chemical companies whose influence in government led to some strange and unfriendly French law, an example being to outlaw the manufacturing for sale of nettle soup, or 'purin d'ortie'. The humble nettle is now the symbol for a groundswell of French opinion and desire to reclaim better methods of husbandry for the planet as a whole. The law has recently been relaxed.

Once we got down, we drove around the south end of the Sierras, a beautiful drive through a variety of scenery. The green meadows and hillsides scattered with oak trees are lovely. We stopped overnight at a KOA at Isabella Lake and the next day continued up the west side of the Sierras to Sequoia National Park where we stayed at Buckeye campground and ate in Three Rivers at the Gateway Inn on a wonderful terrace overlooking the river.

I’m determined not to let this experience be defined by that box of Chex, though. I have no way of knowing, right now, whether he’ll have to swear off gluten and/or casein in the long term, or whether we’ll be lucky enough to discover six weeks from now that the elimination period was all he had to go through. On Day One, I was planning to approach this as a short-term thing, and vowed not to go crazy buying special products or trying to bake gluten-free bread; but then again, I’m not the kind of person who can go half-in for much of anything. If we’re going to be GF/CF for six weeks, six months, or six years, we’re going to do it the best we can. I’m not going to let Chex cereal and GF/CF convenience foods become my crutch.

Location certainly affects character. My Romans are naturally garrulous and largely optimistic at heart and congenitally emotional. Lund comes from a cold climate and, like the British, mimics that in her character. It’s interesting that we seem to be more interested in gloomy, dark chilly characters and locations at the moment. Perhaps it reflects the state of the world. We’re pessimistic and look to the north instead of the south. There’s battered beauty in Copenhagen though. And I did hire a bike and pedal round the wood on the city outskirts where the dark credit sequence takes place (it’s actually a very nice nature

Where an IDS is filed after the mailing date of a notice of allowability or a notice of allowance under § 1.311, applicant would be required to provide an appropriate patentability justification, which includes the explanation and non-cumulative description required after a first Office action, and reasons why the claims are patentable over the cited document(s).

For me, learning this concept (and it’s taken many years for me to understand it deeply, in the core of my being) has contributed hugely to my sanity. Perhaps people aren’t as crazy or irrational as they seem. Perhaps they are simply responding to a world that looks, feels, and to them IS, not at all the same as ours.

The "security" people, who I guess were there to keep us from running across the street or something. wouldn't let us take pictures of the outside of the house, which I didn't get at all. I snuck a couple of pictures on my cell phone, but they're sideways and I have a new laptop and can't figure out how to use the photo editing software, so you won't get to see them, unless I figure it out. Sorry guys. I did get a picture with one of the stars though! Which I also won't be posting, but it's a pretty good picture. You can email me if you want to see it.

This week I thought I'd share a list of substitutions you can use in the kitchen. If you don't happen to have a specific ingredient, before you run to the store, look for a substitution. There's no need to buy a whole bag of self-rising flour for one recipe. You can make your own!

From October 10-12 some of the best stampers are joining together to support and encourage our friend and fellow stamper, Katie Renz, who is currently battling inoperable gastric cancer. Katie is also dear facebook-game friend of mine, and I want all of you to know her struggles, as she really needs friends and support now more than ever before.
Unrelated to the winning jockey of the 1937 Grand National who bears the same name and also hails from the Cowbridge area, Evan Williams was born on April 3, 1971, on his family’s farm in the village of Llancarfan in the Vale of Glamorgan. He used to get up at dawn to milk the cows before going to school. He took over the running of the farm full-time when he was 17, concentrating firstly on dairy farming and then beef when the price of milk dropped. He also started training a few point-to-pointers in 1997 but the foot and mouth outbreak of 2001 decimated his herd and restrictions on the movement of livestock wiped out the point-to-point season. Williams sold his cattle at a loss after the outbreak and went to Ireland to buy 18 horses with the proceeds, going on to be champion point-to-point trainer and jockey in 2002. He took out his full training licence the following year and rode his first winner, Cherry Gold, in a hunters’ chase at Chepstow on April 22, 2003. Williams enjoyed his first big-race success at the same course in December of that year, when saddling Sunray to win the Finale Juvenile Hurdle at odds of 40/1. The winners continued to flow and Williams shot to national prominence with State Of Play, who followed up success in a handicap chase at Aintree’s John Smith’s Grand National meeting in April, 2006, with victory in the Hennessy Cognac Gold Cup at Newbury seven months later. The chaser has since gone on to triumph in the Charlie Hall Chase at Wetherby in October, while other big race success has arrived courtesy of High Chimes, who gave Williams a first Cheltenham Festival winner in the 2008 Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir Challenge Cup Handicap Chase, and Grade Two scorers Deep Purple and Simarian. In the 2009/10 season, Barizan emerged as a top-class juvenile hurdler, winning a Grade One at Punchestown after finishing second in both the JCB Triumph Hurdle and in the Matalan Anniversary 4-Y-O Hurdle at Aintree. Williams is assisted by top amateur James Tudor, who was champion point-to-point rider in 2007 and partnered High Chimes to his Cheltenham success. He is married to Cath who continued to train point-to-pointers after he took out his professional licence, saddling over 50 winners in two seasons including the prolific Cannon Bridge, who chalked up nine wins in a single campaign. They have three children William, Isabel and Ellie. Evan is the son of former amateur jockey Rhys Williams. John Smith’s Grand National Record: 2009 State Of Play (4th); 2010
On June 3, 1958 or 28 days thereafter, petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration of the decision, which was denied on June 14, 1958, for lack of merit. On June 21, 1958, petitioner filed a notice of appeal and appeal bond. Respondents registered opposition thereto for the reason that the filing of said notice of appeal and appeal bond was made out of time. Sustaining this allegation, the court, by order of July 5, 1950, disapproved petitioner’s appeal bond and notice of appeal.

The kids tumbled out of the bunk bed on their own and in a sunny mood. I sprinkled extra granulated maple syrup on my hot cereal, and it tasted ‘Grrrrr-eeaat!’ The kids got dressed for school, even helping each other out—no screaming or biting at all! Anette threw a few extra things in her suitcase and said good-bye—easy, simple, no fuss. She’s off to teach in Belgium again this week. Then at kindergarten, V. said, ‘Geh weg!’ (meaning ‘You don’t have to help me take off my boots, Papa. Take off, you hoser. Go to work. I’ll be fine.’)

USP: The angst is far more mature and thoughtful than your average teen-years-riffing band. (Yeah, you, Summer Camp.) They also surprise, at times; the acoustic-backed opening of ‘Chair’ is sweet, but nothing to write home about, and then the electric guitar kicks in. Changing tack or adding instruments is in itself nothing new, but they seem so unassuming, almost amateur, at first listen that it genuinely is unexpected.
I was careful not to load my response with anything that would bias her feelings one way or the other. I gave her at least as many reasons to believe as reasons not to. I told her about the version of God that I created when I decided that the Catholic version didn't fit me. I tried my best to guide her in the direction she needed to go, and not the direction I wanted her to go. She's smart enough and mature enough to make up her own mind about what she believes. She's exactly where I was 25 years ago, when I started asking questions about my Catholic upbringing. That was a long journey for me, but I came out the other side with a stronger faith and a better relationship with God - at least for awhile.

–The 80’s carried the torch with Tales From the Darkside (which featured a couple Stephen King penned scripts), The Hitchhiker, Amazing Stories, The Ray Bradbury Theater, and The Twilight Zone (first revival). But I would be remiss if I didn’t mention Freddie’s Nightmares. Robert Englund will ALWAYS be remembered as the Springwood Slasher, but this show didn’t have enough Freddy. It retained the slasher film acting talent and repackaged crap stories into a series that cheapened an already cheapened franchise.

Only a collective and conscious movement of students around GSCASH can effectively strengthen it. A movement that collectively ensures that woman students feel confident enough to report cases of sexual harassment and are not forced to retreat owing to mounting social pressures. A conscious movement that rejects and resists the culture of slander, flaunting of male machismo, asking for sexual favours or harassing women in any form. Where women are not forced to constantly adjust their behaviour according to the male choices or diktats. Bodies and minds are not forced and tortured to adhere to beauty, chastity, housewife roles and rules – the prevalent feudal and consumerist morality. We must recognize that atrocious incidents like the MMS scandal has happened in our self-proclaimed progressive campus along with numerous other incidents of violence and harassment. The right-wing forces whose politics flow solely from fascism and feudalism play a major role in maintaining the oppressive assaults of patriarchy and its crude manifestations in the campus too. The blatant shielding of sexual harassers by various so-called ‘left’ organizations like SFI and AISA only strengthen the same reactionary, regressive anti-woman status-quo.
Greer’s contacts confirmed the PLF technology was acquired from ETs – and involves advanced cloning principles to create a “biological robot”.
The second reason it is unfortunate the show failed to mention the fact that Chloe is male is that this is yet another instance where outrageous male behavior is being reported as female behavior. As I said before, when a “woman” was reported to be living her life as an “adult baby”, messing herself and selling porn about it (and “she” turned out to be a dude): when you hear about a female doing something really wack, or read about it in a newspaper or on a website, and it just “doesn’t sound right” to you: It’s probably a male transgender.

that said, it’s been really nice to watch a game just to watch it. almost like a vacation. i haven’t had to worry about what pitch pitcher X on team Y threw to batter A on team B. haven’t had to root against my mets because i had the other teams starter going against them. and i don’t need to give a shit about the backup backup catcher on any team because as usual my first 2 catchers went down.
What I liked most about DF was the inescapable question it raised about privacy and national security. The story is about the NSA, an organization dedicated to breaking codes and intercepting potential threats. Naturally the NSA faces a lot of resistance by groups advocating for privacy. The reader is forced to form some opinions of their own. Would you mind if the NSA was snooping through your email? What should have to be sacrificed for national security, if anything? Who is right in this situation? Anyway, the unavoidable questions sparked a great discussion between Joey and I, I’ll spare you the details.

At the moment, a town of 20,000 people with a single church might have one that seemed to be thriving, with a church membership of 300 and all sorts of activities and services, whereas a small village with a population of less than 500 might seem to be failing, with a church membership of 16 - yet the latter would be 'above average' and the former quite significantly below. A formula for deploying clergy that places emphasis upon population will never challenge the former to grow, and will continue to reduce the resources available to the latter despite their progress in advancing the cause of the Kingdom.

After covering my cake with whipped cream and piping a shell border on the bottom, I returned it to the fridge and then began to make my ganache glaze. I used an Ina Garten recipe, and it was so simple to make - just semisweet chocolate, heavy cream! I didn't want the glaze to melt the whipped cream on my cake, so I waited for it to come to room temperature first. But perhaps I waited too long, because by the time I spread it over my cake, it wasn't drippy enough to ooze down the sides!
Not all doctors approve of weight loss surgery on the young; some feel it is simply too drastic to operate on patients whose bodies (and minds) are still developing, and who, by definition, have had only limited time to learn other successful weight loss strategies.
So begins our favorite Thanksgiving read-aloud. This sweet short story of how the children in a Quaker family came to the aid of a very ill and former Baker General in the Army will warm your heart. Charles Ludwig was a real person appointed to the position by President Washington who really did declare the first thanksgiving proclamation by the new government in 1789. The resolve and determination of 15-year-old Lydia and 11-year-old Deborah is inspiring.

It looks like all the “bribes” to the people given by Najib’s government that have come to billions of ringgit thus far are not going to be turned into votes for UMNO and Barisan Nasional. The Opposition has a good prospect of toppling the incumbent government.
On March 19, 2011, President Obama, an African Descendent, left a “Bitter Taste” in Brazil, a nation of color, by launching an unjust unilateral aerial assault against the African sovereign nation of Libya [7] solely in the interest of Africa’s former white supremacist murderous colonists responsible for plunder of the mother country’s resources and slaughter of millions. President Obama’s justification to attack Libya because of an imminent “humanitarian threat” to innocent civilians was and remains a cold hearted vicious and outrageous fabrication, deception and war crime.[8]
As a Harvard graduate student, I came to know numerous radical activists. I have posed this questions to many of them, and in most cases only heard that “a new way has to be found” or that “it is impossible to understand the socialist future when living under capitalist conditions”. Other activists, however, told me that they are not against the state as such, only against the nation-state. That distinction is, however, irrelevant. Because what they criticize in the nation-state is first and foremost its power to command, penetrate and control. Unfortunately, power is just the aspect of the state that they need in order to implement their projects. The dream of social equality requires more power, more coercion, and more ideological indoctrination to enforce it. So even if the nation-state will be abolished and another, unidentified state will rise from its ashes, it will still have to exercise power; Lots and lots of power, in order to implement social projects. So we are back at point zero, and the paradox remains acute as ever.

Given then that we have no serious crime here…I can only assume that it also means that we don’t have state abuse of public funds….what we have is Cabinet-approved spending for undocumented things.
We have also seen that the apostle Paul had the blessing of Jesus Christ in going to Rome. But whenever God is doing a work Satan serves as an adversary seeking to disrupt the divine plan. I draw your attention to 1 Corinthians 16:9. “For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries.”
And, Caring Not for Gold nor Groats,
states are allowing the local districts and event he schools themselves select the textbooks, coordinate the teaching within the schools' departments, and have all asked for parental input in that selection. But still, these folks who are convinced it is a scheme from President Obama to brainwash our kids amaze me. Do they really think he is that smart?! Or that he cares that much?!
Doctors will try to balance this by improving how traffic flows through their clinic so that they can spend as much time as possible with patients. Time checking on results, running back and forth between rooms, and waiting for a room so it can be used for the next patient are all examples of patient flow that can be managed and improved.

The Bi-State Authority members are not empowered to set toll rates, so they can only speculate what tolls may be. They also assumed that the Federal Government will allow tolls on infrastructures that have already been paid for as a means of fundraising for new structures (two new bridges plus the Interstate connectors known as “Spaghetti Junction.”) The Federal Government requires that toll revenues be used exclusively for the facility being tolled yet the Bi-State Authority thinks they have a means to get around this historic protocol.
And I am sure others around me are thinking: bitch ain’t got no time, so why write the long rant?
This book not only challenges capitalism’s traditional marketing paradigm but the very “genes” of capitalism. If any book is going to launch a New Capitalism of Caring, it is this book that redefines great companies as stakeholder value builders, not just shareholder agents.

See the shoes in the picture above - they are Star Wars shoes and... they light up... Nolan has been having a blast lighting them up. At daycare he and his friend Gavin ran around saying 'one, two, three - light-up' and they would jump to get them to light-up. The only rule I had for Daddy and Nolan when they went to buy shoes before was "No light-up shoes" and this time I'm with them and without thinking I told Nolan he could have starwars shoes. So now he has lightup shoes, we'll see how long the lights keep flashing. And because he got Star Wars shoes Daddy and Nolan had to watch the Star Wars - Clone Wars cartoon so he would know that his shoes were supposed to look like Storm Troopers

Anyway, this weekend I picked up a box of Valentine cards for each of the kids so in addition to the crafts we did at my dad's house, I had plans to do our own thing too. Last night Haylee scribbled circles onto her Dora cards while Ryan took his time and did well on his baseball ones. We put a little baggie of conversation hearts with each card so they could hand them out to their friends at daycare.
You can see on this crime website that it is fact that Loughton has a higher crime rate than Debden. It doesn't show the trouble to be concentrated to the high road either.
As for today? Well, what better way to spend my 100th day than with a general audition for ATYP’s Under the Wharf (which seemed to go quite well). It was great chatting to AD Fraser Corfield about acting, studying and battling it out in this harsh industry and doing anything and everything to get your foot through the door! It was a very encouraging chat indeed! I followed my audition with a session in my home filming some self-tests for my agent. A day well spent!
I don't feel bad in the slightest that this loser is gone, but I do feel bad for his two innocent victims, one of whom was still a teen. And of course he has to make us gun folk look bad on his way off the planet. Good riddance to him, I say.
We have been fortunate that this damaged presidency has occurred during a time of relative peace and prosperity. In times of war or national emergency it is often necessary for the President to call upon the nation to make great economic and personal sacrifices. In these occasions, our President had best be trustworthy--a truth teller whose life of principled leadership and integrity we can count upon. Some commentators have suggested that with the President having less than two years left in his term of office, the easiest approach is to let the clock expire while hoping that he is sufficiently careful, if not contrite, to avoid reckless and indefensible conduct. But as Senators, we know that the dangers of the world constantly threaten us. Rarely do two years pass without the need for strong Presidential leadership and the exercise of substantial moral authority from the White House.

There’s your set up. Sonia is played by the Russian actress Kseniya Rappoport. She’s quite good in this role which calls for her to be somewhat haunted, mysterious, sexy, and there are other things about her that you can’t quite put your finger on.
We've had a chance to live with these pillows for a bit now, and I have to say that I'm a big fan of the long lumbar style, especially for a deep couch like ours. The pillows provide nice back support, but don't get in the way at all like big square throw pillows sometimes do.

The news outlet reports Michelle Rodman is identified in the documents as a Costa Mesa, California resident. She is also requesting attorneys’ fees.
But, unfortunately, the pie is only so big! The civil service, corporate boards, media and town names have all been Africanized. The so-called 'Black Diamonds' (middle-class blacks) are nothing but debt-ridden dismally incompetent feel-good replacements for the qualified pale males who were forced to vacate their jobs in order to vindicate the sensibilities of those who claim to have conquered the eternal moral high-ground. The Rule of Law has broken down and the skills capacity to sustain a knowledge-driven economy has all but ceased in the economic powerhouse of Africa…..the only real hope for an African Renaissance! So what is left to devour? Not much I’m afraid - and heaven forbid when you lose a preciously creamy bit, like Helen Zille’s Cape Town. No real new sustainable jobs have being created, unofficial unemployment stands at 40% and the existing wealth has been hijacked by the obligatory greed and corruption that characterizes the post-colonial African mindset.

This is a good step forward but making a "hate list" of specific things will only carry you so far and really it's better to let go of the hate and "accept the things you cannot change". If you don't do this, things will simply build up until you explode or are overcome by depression.

Even though the police put the race of the victim in the incident report, the media censored this information. A reporter for the Orlando Sentinel confirmed that the race of the victim was omitted on purpose. The Orlando Sentinel removed the suspects’ mug shots shortly after CofCC.org wrote about the attack.

A good query letter is not difficult to write if you remember to leave out the irrelevant. Over the years, as a literary agent and someone who publishes other authors’ articles on my websites, I’ve seen some serious mistakes in query letters that have made me quickly think otherwise about publishing an author’s work. Following are a few tips on what you should and should not include in a query letter.
”Part of being an ethical Christian parent is admitting that we need grace as much as our children do and we always have. We don't exact perfection from our children by telling them how perfect we were. That only serves to discourage them. They already have a heart to please us, and we have to take the utmost care in nurturing that heart toward the things of God. We are not perfect--but He is.”

I sit at the island in the kitchen and look out. Outside, the world looks an oppressive grey and the hills sit in suspended animation on the horizon with rain-filled clouds sagging over them, waiting to burst. Autumn has applied its brush strokes to the surrounding countryside. Leaves have turned to browns and ochre as green chlorophyll is leached from the trees. Hedgerows bulge with brambles and hawthorns. Elderberry and apple trees bow under the weight of fruit. The swallows have gone but finches, buntings and sparrows flock across the country lanes. Fields lay bare; the harvest gathered and already turned over by ploughs leaves pheasants and partridges exposed. Next door’s straw is stacked against our fencing for winter use. In our courtyard, freshly delivered logs sit neatly stacked, ready for the first fire of the season.

The relationship lasted for just over a year until de Vaux’s untimely death from tuberculosis only two days after her 31st birthday in 1846. Over the year, Comte’s feelings became close to an obsession and each meeting and word from de Vaux took on almost a religious significance. De Vaux herself was a practising Catholic whilst Comte was a scientific athiest. He saw de Vaux as his moral superior and began to infuse his theories of the human condition with a more religious flavour. He concluded that cults and celebrations are indispensable for mankind although he still leaned away from Catholicism and the traditional church.
These are the radical activist. These are the people who are not simply ‘non-religious’ or unwilling to accept God and His dominion, but hate the idea of God telling them what or what not to do. They’re also not patriots, but like the current President, find horrendous wrongs and injustices with the USA – not exceptionalism.

First, he takes out a couple of Andre’s employees in a bar with some well-timed jabs to the sternum. This prompts Darren to put Reese on retainer for twenty-five cents (a bargain if ever I saw one!). Reese then finds a couple more thugs named Curtis and Trim, and steals their Escalade. For the record, Curtis and Trim are the next great comedy duo. Trim wants Curtis to call the insurance company, but Curtis reminds him that the of them stole the car in the first place. Trim then suggests that since Curtis bought new rims for it, they might replace those. Hilarious.

He closed the scroll, handed it back to the attendant and sat down. The eyes of everyone in the place were fastened on him. He had read the scriptures with an authority and a grace with which they were unaccustomed. Then, he dropped the bomb on them!
As far as I can tell it is only available for purchase at Eataly in NYC. I have never seen it otherwise, but this is not a claim we have been everywhere. I have tried other Asian black rices before and find them very fragrant, nutty, and filling.

Then it is still chewy with a nutty flavor.

Szobody claims these young people have "a different view of how Christians interact with culture.":King lays out the timeline this way: The social gospel movement of the 1920s and 1930s aimed at transforming institutions, which was followed by an emphasis on saving individual souls, and then the Religious Right generation sought to use politics as a tool. Preserving prayer in schools, the Ten Commandments in courthouses and “under God” in the pledge while fighting abortion and gay marriage were their causes.
Right now, I'm sitting in a villa in Orlando as part of a huge gang of women who have gone before me, come after me or are somewhere near where I am in this journey of parenting a child of trauma. We represent mamas who've adopted from CPS, other countries, had bio kids, have step kids, grandkids, are foster parents and experience the gift of being on the receiving end of the anger at birthmoms, birthmoms' boyfriends, orphanage "care"givers, former foster parents, former adoptive parents, and anyone who've abused our kids.
Days and weeks are moving on. Some days are easy, some are very tough. The best I can do is to take one day at a time, and be thankful for the ways I have been so amazingly blessed.

This is the time of year when my houseplants reign supreme. Deprived of outdoor gardening, I focus my considerable nurturing energies on the plants that live inside, with me. I spritz them with tepid water once a day; I whisk away the least dry leaf before it can fall to the floor; and I have to hold myself back from over watering and over fertilizing.
Before I entered their house, I searched through my planner looking for the number and couldn’t find it, but I thought that I would just let my instincts guide me. Well, my instincts were wrong and next thing I knew the alarm was going off, and the police were there.
Anyway, enough waffling and onto the crafting. This week has seen the birthday of a friend who has become especially dear to me. Elaine is one of my Craft Stamping Quartet buddies as many of my visitors already know and along with Jo and Judith she has become one of the main 'constants' in my life so making a card incorporating things she likes was such a pleasure to do. Elaine loves nature and has a huge wild garden with lots of mature trees and I know she loves it in whatever coat it happens to be wearing. As it's September, I decided to go with an Autumnal look both with the colours I used and also with the leaf embellishments. Elaine knows one of my favourite things to do is blending inks over masks and as Chocolate Baroque have just started stocking some exceptionally pretty Prima ones which I couldn't resist buying I thought that's where I would start my design. I followed this with some light overstamping using a stamp from an Inkadinkado set called Autumn Fall which I must have had for at least 2 years and never inked up. Shame on me because the stamps are really dainty with lovely leafy swirls.
However, don't expect, honesty, fairness, or anything approaching truth from Channel Four or any Western media.
Alright, back to the lecture at hand.
The challenge is more than one fold, so I have made an Easel card, Ive used this lovely stamped image from Hooked on craft, called Honey bears, coloured with promarkers, mounted on Xcut round die cuts, backing paper is Papermaina capsule, Flowers and foliage from http://www.hookedoncraft.com/ the sentiment is from Cindy, Ribbon, lace and button from stash.
The change is unnecessary. Challenging this change also draws attention to the fact that Christianity is very much in favor of history, for it has just as much to do with our future.

If you do not have faith, you may either let yourself go, or else fight with all of your intelligence and might, or else seek help from anyone in the visible or invisible worlds. Heaven abandons the inert! the arrogant, who only believe in themselves, Heaven abandons them too; the fearful, Heaven lends them a helping hand which gives them sufficient time to harness their forces and them to work. But if you are a disciple you know that Heaven sees and watches over you, and that in spite of your being lukewarm Heaven will never let you perish.
Tip Eight–Stock Up and Put It Up
The answer was "no". Geary's London Porter always strikes me as a well-balanced, easy drinking porter with not too much roasted malt and a lighter body. There are some sweeter, almost toffee-like notes that paired nicely with the more intense nutty and buttery taste of the cheese, like a complementary relationship, with one side making up in the places the other lacks. Not that either lack anything as far as taste goes, but you get my drift; good accompaniment. The carbonation battled the delicious saltiness and lifted the fat and proteins that coated the tongue. A solid pairing, even for going a little out on a limb.
But, maybe if I keep doing it, then I might start having to let go less and less and then before long, I will have let go without even realising it...
That’s all I have time for today, on to Thursday.

The Sixers have become one of the most well rounded teams in the league. They can do a little bit of everything well and Doug Collins has them believing that they can beat anyone in the league. When this season is all said and done, expect to hear Collins name pop up quite a bit for coach of the year barring a catastrophic meltdown on the Sixers part which I do not expect. The Sixers have done a great job since their horrible start of avoiding long losing streaks.

The thirty-three poems found within the covers of her latest poetry collection, Shadow Crossing are often enigmatic, although some general comments can be proffered. The first eleven poems are grouped under the section title, “The Path of No Return.” Here, the “path” can, perhaps, be interpreted as the arc of an individual life, as the poems tend to deal with significant, formative experiences, the cruelty, absurdity and mystery of life and possible responses to such. The first poem, “In Apogee,” lays out the need to understand the forces that shape us, in its opening lines:
A million baby kisses I’m gonna deliver
I didn’t strategise how I would show them

In all cases, smoking should be avoided. Since alcohol can irritate the throat, consumption may need to be limited.
What I long to learn now, and what these journeys of adoption have been teaching me, is to release my children to their Father every day. To parent out of a place of faith and grace. Faith that God is in control, and He loves these precious little ones far more than I do. Grace to let them be who God created them to be and not burden them with heavy expectations or the worries of a mom who always fears for them.

A new event sponsored by Buckaroo Book Shop (AKA OutWest) were some literary panels. I especially loved the discussion of True Grit, comparing the two films to the book. It was chaired by C.

“Two down,” her sick mind informed her sardonically as she stepped over the corpse of the captain. She bent to pick up the little ceramic lamp and filled it with oil from the captain’s flask. When the lamp flickered to life, she found she was in a room shaped much like the one above, except this one was carved and polished rock salt. Shining like crystal, the chamber was a faceted dome with the stone ladder descending like a column down the center. Four carved archways, spaced equally, led from the room. There was a tinkling sound coming from each, and Sharia gasped to see small streams of water running down the center of each hallway to splash through grates at the threshold of each as they entered the chamber where she stood. She had lost her sense of direction, and so turned to the nearest.

93% of Balinese are Hindu’s. If you tell them that you are Indian, their eyes light up with a spark of recognition, “Are you Hindu?” they ask immediately, wanting to find common grounds to identify with you. The Balinese are not extremist’s, but are devout in the worship, and carry on with their daily processions in fun nonchalance. Almost every day there is a procession, as lines of men and women wearing white wrap around’s that look very much like the Indian dhoti teemed with white shirts for the men, and transparent white laced tops for the women, with colorful turbans tied royally around the heads of men, walk the streets, with flowers and song.

Hopefully your corner of the world had the same awesome spring weather we had in my corner of the world. Clear skies, warm temperatures - perfect day to spend hours working in the yard. Which is exactly why I did anything but work in the yard. Yard work sucks, and time is better spent having fun, so today included sleeping in, getting breakfast, finalizing some gifts, getting the dogs' nails trimmed, going for a bike ride on the Schuykill River Trail, getting an afternoon beer, stocking the beer/wine cellar at Total Wine, and dinner at Fellini's. Couldn't ask for anything more. Except for a gardener to clean up the yard... it looks like the Amazon rain forest out there.

that did not stop me from making videos though and after several videos, i admit, i terhanyut. i was noob then. i was overwhelmed with the attention i got from my videos that i got over my head. lagi lagi after the scarflets. we got called for photoshoots, we received invitations to events, and all that jazz. in the beginning, it was very exciting. but alas, it's very misleading..
Honestly, I have no idea. I know I hate being home alone with S, and I know that is what I do all of the time. But recently I had an evening without him-- and I had no idea what to do with myself. What did I even do before I had kids? How did I spend my time? What made me happy?
But enough about that...
A lot has to do with my mental health. I can combat fatigue with activity. The more active I am, the less I notice the fatigue. It’s still there, and I require more recovery time than someone of my age. When I give in to fatigue and allow it to drag me down into a morass of pain and inactivity, I feel every step, every motion of activity. A simple walk down the driveway requires hours of rest. It’s a matter of overcoming that hurdle and DOING that makes each step easier. I can’t accomplish it overnight, but I can accomplish it.

And now for the cookies. I made these a few days ago for my brother who is down in the Sacramento area playing in a high school basketball tournament (send him good vibes for me please). Although he was happy to be playing basketball, he was not so thrilled about spending half of his Christmas break away from home. In order to cheer him up, I baked a big batch of m&m cookies for him to take along with him (and of course I saved a few for myself).
I hope you all had lots of turkey on Thanksgiving Day and are enjoying the short work week...

As always the Treacy family and their exemplary team headed by the never-ageing Niamh O Shea looked after us with that characteristic “warmth beyond the smile”. This year Padraig Treacy went the extra mile. Or, rather, the extra 10 miles by leading us on a wilderness walk that took us across the side of Tomies Mountain and back to the lakeshore at Dinis Cottage. It was a challenging walk with that vague edge of soft danger to it leaving you with a real sense of achievement at the end. The scenery was breathtaking, sufficient to render a predominantly female group speechless from time and time and evoking in us all what Wordsworth called that “serene and blessed mood”.

I got my first full week of work in for my momma, and it has been INSANE. There is so much work to be done, more than I expected. It’s pretty awesome though, we decided my new title is Administrative Specialist. That means…well…I don’t know exactly but pretty much, I am catching up on everything that is behind (and there is a LOT), I am creating/editing/adjusting job descriptions and doing the training on the new procedures and rules. It’s a pretty intense job compared to what I have done the past two years, compared to what I have been doing for my mom the past 5 months. I love it, but I am going to be so so so happy once it’s all done. The pressure is on too, because we want this big job done by the end of the year. I also am going to be starting college again in January, and taking a full schedule, so the time and availability to be working so much is going straight out the window. All this heavy workload MUST be done before I go back. Period.
After my first week, I had already been handed a number of projects, mainly building media proposals for perspective clients, in addition to my media buying responsibilities. Frankly, I was startled by the volume of work being throw my way. Suddenly I was feeling utilized and needed again, and I was being stretched professionally in ways I never thought possible. But I thrive on that and enjoy developing efficiency procedures for myself which enable me to turn projects around more quickly and hand them off upon completion.

First spot to go was on my hip. Didn’t feel a thing. I got an enormous bandage that sort of looked like perhaps a rabid animal had bitten me. Maybe even a shark.

I skipped the gym for a few days, haven’t been swimming in 2 weeks and have been going through hydrogen peroxide like it’s going out of style.

Derere bought maize about four times. Then on the fifth time Dotito said, “Can we finish our food and give it to you?” He refused to give them their green maize. Then Derere was very angry. He gathered his people and fought against the vaRozwi and conquered them. Their chief Dotito and others were killed, and some ran away. Derere took everything they had from those people. After this Derere was the chief of all the Chishawasha section. Then Derere and his people went around all Chishawasha looking for good lands and water as well as gardens. Then they were very happy.

But for me personally, the signposts on the album that indicate routes down the ‘Punk’ or ‘Reggae’ tracks would seem more attractive. If I may digress just briefly: the only two tracks I’m aware of Poly performing in recent years were ‘alternative’ Christmas songs. The first was a duet with Goldblade frontman, John Robb (another who can do nothing wrong in my book!) called ‘City of Christmas Ghosts.’ This is essentially a stomping punk anthem of a song.

My journey into the music media industry has been a relatively easy one – thus far. Yes, I’m no big shot, and getting pieces published are still as rare a spectacle as a two-tone wearing khaki boer – comb in socks – attending an In Flames concert. But through various endeavours, and special arrangements, I have had the privilege to interview some of the big boys within the musical playing field. Taking my interviews, and the pieces I write very serious – I make it a priority to not only be well rehearsed, but also in possession of a different and unique set of questions, that will make my interview as memorable – as an interview can possibly be. I want bands and musicians to step away from my interview thinking, “Fresh perspective, down to earth line of thought – not just another mind numbing interview – something worthwhile. “

The bullpen was utilized heavily as Erik Bedard was pulled with only 3 pitches into the 2nd inning with back spasms. Using 5 different pitchers in 8 innings, the Pirates bullpen allowed only 1 earned run in the 7th inning off Juan Cruz. Closer Joel Hanrahan tried to redeem himself for last night's blown save, but made it very interesting by loading the bases with only 1 out in the 9th before he got Bryce Harper to pop out and Ryan Zimmerman to strike out leaving the bases loaded.

Subject matter is an important element in novel writing. What, who and when are issues that can determine the impact a novelist makes on the publishing community. For a publisher, marketing issues are paramount. Since the public is notoriously fickle in its interests, the publishing marketer often has to anticipate what will most engage the public mind in the twelve to eighteen months it will take for a mainstream publisher to produce and market a book. For non-fiction it is a lot easier to anticipate. For fiction, publishers need to consult a psychic.
We've come a long way downhill since those critical decades. Today, the suggestion that there should be any topics, any areas of enterprise, or any venues of human interaction deemed off limits to the State is considered "controversial." Property is now considered conditional. A man's body is a thing to be regulated and "protected" by political force. Even freedom of speech is widely regarded as a charming vestige of a primitive time: something our forebears could tolerate, but which our "more complex era" cannot afford. In all things, the needs of the State come first -- and woe to him who thinks to stand in its way.

We tend to assume our senses are accurate, but research has shown time and again that what we believe that we see, hear, taste, touch or smell can easily be primed by what we expect to experience. See Rachel Herz: The Scent of Desire. Much of what we sense seems to be what we imagine we sense. At the same time, we often ignore or dismiss as ordinary the sounds and sights we see every day, and we don’t seem capable of perceiving most odors once we’ve been around them for a while.

We had to cancel the appointment at Yards and drive on to Brandywine Brewing near Wilmington in heavy rain.

So I suppose my makey-fingers have had their exercise for a while, but this is pretty much how things go around here- inactivity in the craft department (or nothing going on of note), then I find the energy (and drive) to zoom about until the early hours for a few days in a row, just to finish those things that need finishing!

This is my first beaded necklace. The clasp is the kitten stretched out with the ball of yarn between its front paws. The charm is the kitten on its back with the ball of yarn between all four paws.

The charm and clasp are silver.
At this point in the conversation last night, I mentioned that I had a ton of respect for a movie starring Jodie Foster called The Brave One.

Kinda like Batman, but without the main character growling every line.

On another end of the spectrum is the Imperial Workhorse IPA. The original gravity was bumped up from 17º Plato to 19.5º Plato resulting in an ABV of about 9.5%. To balance this out, the hops were increased to contribute about 15 more IBUs over the standard Workhorse. This beer contains plenty of hops presenting a firm bitterness and a pleasant resinous character. The malts provide a good balance with some sweetness coming through. I overheard mention that no hop extract was used but that some hop pellets were ground up before use in hopes of better utilization. Not as cloying as this year's Green Mammoth but also lacking some of the over the top aromatics of that brew, this fits in nicely between that and their standard IPAs.

When I was in the circus, I remember a clown telling me that he’d been molested by the big cat trainer, a fine lusty woman who had worked as a lifeguard before joining the circus. He alleged that she had sat on his face when he was relaxing after a show.

There are whole worlds tied up in my marriage. Men, women, parents, siblings, nieces, nephews, the occasional cat or a dog and a series of birds are all part of the mix. My spouse and I met overseas. Our first wedding was engineered, literally, by a committee in a village on the side of a mountain in Africa. On the morning of my second wedding, I fielded phone calls from France, wore a locket that was generations old and hoped I wouldn’t regret my shoe choice or forget my soon to be Aunt’s names. Those were just the weddings.

He never asked to be born athletic or handsome or charismatic or left-handed. He never got a vote to be placed into a missionary family or to be granted some skills that prove fruitful within America’s chosen obsession. But he DOES set himself on being a man of substance, one in whom kindness appears genuine, humility seems sincere, and purity is said to be authentic.

2. One of the most fun aspects of Cassel is his elaborate cons, like trying to get the cat from the animal rescue. How much research did you do in this area?
Despite being weary when we arrived in London directly from San Francisco a couple of Sundays ago, we checked immediately into our hotel before heading straight out to the South Bank's Royal Festival Hall to catch up with a couple of old friends and meet their baby daughter who had been no more than a tiny bump when they'd stayed with us in San Francisco a year earlier. After enjoying an hour or two of their company over a couple of large and refreshing Pimms studded with fresh fruits and mint leaves and topped up with sparkling lemonade, we decided that although at 7pm, it was uncommonly early for us to even think about dinner, if we didn't dine soon, we would probably fall fast asleep.

In the meantime I've been working on this for one of my best friends! She ordered a pink snood so a pink snood she shall have. She thinks it won't be done until at least Christmas but I'm hoping to finish for her birthday at the end of May... We'll see :-)
Emerald Faeries gave us some digis to play with so check out the inspiration below, starting with our Guest Designer this month Martina.
Would an all-white population behave exactly like the Japanese? There might be a bit of looting and profiteering, but not much. Most whites would help their neighbors, stand in line, wait their turn. And they would probably deal harshly with looters.
To be honest I’m a little surprised the folk at Pocket Sketches sent me some samples, but for me the notebook was such a specialised and unusual concept that I was happy to accept and put a mini review on the blog. Being tech savvy folk they even included a little sheet suggesting keywords and links to put in the review to help their search engine results ranking.
Maybe I'm just getting old and it's just something I'm not ever going to understand. Just seems like such a waste of money to me.
He then maneuvered me to the outside of my stool and said simply Let's go. He moved aside and waited for me to take the lead.

We had Easter at our house this year. My parents, along with my Aunt and Uncle came up from Illinois. I cooked Saturday night and then we went to an Easter Buffet on Sunday. It was at a really good restaurant called Frattellos. It was right on the river and had a huge outdoor bar and party area with tons of boat slips, it made me think about how much fun it probably is in the summertime. I guess they have live music out there a few times a week too! Saturday we atteneded an egg hunt at the park near our house. There were were a TON of people, and not really enough eggs. It was actually kind of chaotic and made me never want to attend another one. Hah! The Easter Bunny was walking around the grounds, so there were hoards of people surrounding him at all times with no real lines to stand it to actually get a picture with him or anything. Oh well.
Things happened. Stupid stuff happened. Inmates got locked up. The Captain managed to piss me off and hurt my feelings just a little bit which pissed me off even more.

Well you know how the artistic temperament is but I’m sure that in time, Simon will be painting another piece for another fundraiser. There are still a lot of people who could use money and at this point helping others seems to be in Simon’s feet.
Bing.com Synopsis: “The fabulously successful Pillow Talk was essentially Shop Around the Corner for the 1950s. Playboy composer Rock Hudson and interior-decorator Doris Day are obliged to share a telephone party line. Naturally, their calls overlap at the least opportune times, and just as naturally, this leads to Hudson and Day despising each other without ever having met in person. In a cute but convenient coincidence, Doris’s boy friend is Tony Randall, who also happens to be Hudson’s best pal. Thus Hudson gets a glimpse at Day, and it’s love at first sight. . . .”
A vivid, elegant, nuanced ale, with a very persuasive citrus kick, a thirst-annihilating crispness, and with a broad enough appeal to satisfy all lovers of fine ale.
Recently I've been kind of consumed with the idea of going back to my first crafting dream of bookbinding. If you've been reading this drivel for 5+ years you may remember that I made some early attempts not long after we'd moved to Tiny Town in an attempt to find something to occupy my time while job hunting and learning French (you can see some of my finished books here). I felt kind of stuck because I knew I wasn't doing most of right but I was having trouble figuring out where to go from there. I usually don't do well learning on my own and prefer the help of a tutor but I wasn't getting anywhere so eventually I dropped it and picked up knitting (much to my bank account's chagrin).
Time passes in Eos and Riki continues being a rebellious asshole. He doesn’t get along well with any of the other Pets at all. Oh yeah, he’s all tough around the other pets, but when Iason’s got him alone, I’m sure he’s quite the mild and meek one.

The book, Mantra Yoga and the Primal Sound by Dr. David Frawley is not simply a collection of mantras or an expression of their moral significance; it is an interpretation of the philosophy and the reality of the mantric approach to intelligence and knowledge held within the sound code or vibratory pattern behind the universe itself.
I was able to get 8 more polka dot blocks done this week. Looking at these, I think I need to use more green. I have about 28-29 done. The quilt calls for 50 but I think I want to make 56. I guess I better check out the Farmer’s Wife book for six extra. Maybe I will wait to get all 50 done first so I won’t accidently duplicate or closely match one of the current ones.

As I write in this blog, I try to use things that God is showing me in my own life.
One thing I always imagined until they proved me wrong was that it was impossible not to make money by running a bank. I am full of s**t, as you know from reading this blog - but so are they, it seems. See http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2106237/Loo-view-The-dizzying-heights-bankers-ivory-tower-toilet.html.
So like my previous post of the fall tv guide, I decided I want to do a fall movie post. I only saw one movie this whole summer, sad! And what's really sad is it was a terrible movie: Charlie St. Cloud. I basically paid $10 to stare at Zac Efron for an hour and a half, which I suppose could have been worse. Okay have you not seen 17 Again!? I hate to admit it, but he's kind of adorable. Anyway, I keep seeing previews for movies coming out this fall and there are so many I want to see! I think there are going to be a lot of movie nights in our future...

The passionate revolutionary, John Adams, wrote legendary letters to his wife Abigail as the couple weathered many months apart as Adams fought for the independence of America night and day.

For many years I’ve been telling folk tales and fairytales to children, especially around Halloween time, and one of my (and their) favourites is a story from the Lincolnshire fen country called ‘The Dead Moon’. In brief, it’s the tale of how the Moon herself came down one night to see the dangerous boggy fens, full of corpse- candles and dead folk and other creeping horrors - and was seized by the bogles and pulled down into the bog so there was no more moonlight to help travellers find their way. How the story ends you can find out in Katharine Briggs ‘A Dictionary of Fairies’.

For no less than 15 days, the males periodically lift their wings and necks upwards before the object of their affection (which changes every couple of years. Typical).
I'm always amused by the uniform I see in Bangkok, which shifts with each visit. This visit, I could not stop seeing scallop-edged tap shorts with blouses tucked in, amongst the long dresses and skirts I saw late last year. At Chatuchak Market, where I spent a good part of Saturday, I saw vintage silk button-down blouses over and over again, all with their sleeves rolled up, which made me think of this uniform.
Beltane was a Celtic calendar feast ushering in the start of summer. (It also went by a variety of other spellings and names in assorted dialects of Gaelic.)

I don’t want to get bogged down in this. Lets just say that none of that is remotely true – and leave it at that.
Yellow Peel Passion Fruit - here the very smooth outside peel is a pale yellow color, the gelatinous liquid is yellow, and the seeds are dark. This variety also tastes divine. This particular one was very juicy, and slightly acidic....making it very good! The little white nubbies inside are really soft and pliable which is a nice mechanism for protecting the delicate fruit inside. It's no wonder that passion fruit finds its way into many dessert and pastry delicacies...
Like I say, I'd be greatly pleased if you took the time to drop in. Those of you who have visited this here blog have greatly warmed my heart, and the wonderful horror fans whom I've had the opportunity to meet here have made my stay all the better.

During my travels through Peru, I was fascinated by the women of this beautiful country. Their looks, their clothing, their arts and crafts, their day to day lives – be it weaving beautiful textiles or preparing delicious food – I was in awe.

The Over the Rainbow closing scene was beautiful. Jack still seemed confused by his awakening but was enveloped by the warmth and love of his friends. They chose to be of a collective consciousness and physically move on together.
According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon. For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ. Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble; Every man’s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man’s work of what sort it is. If any man’s work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward. If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire. Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.

A good business diversifies. Even Victoria’s Secret sells more than bras. Aid dollars can buy bras in one place and felt in another. Used bras are just bras (and they make terrible cat-hats.) Money has the magic power of turning into almost anything.
So there we sat in the corner, like two Angela Martin's from The Office, contemplating risking our lives to ditch the party. Unfortunately, it was just too late and would have been too reckless on our part to release ourselves to the sea of drunk drivers that inevitably owned the road.

In the meantime, I read a CNN column today that made me laugh. If you want to read it in its entirety, go here. Written by comedian Dean Obeidaliah the short version was this snippet:
About 45-minutes from where I live, a beautiful old juvenile rehabilitation center stands tall against the background of the rolling California foothills. Built in the 1880′s to usher in a new age of helping boys who have taken the wrong path to become upright members of society, Preston Castle – also known by its actual name, the Preston School of Industry – is an amazing specimen of roman revival architecture that you can’t help but want to see up close if given half the chance.
I joined the queue, which was very short – comprising just two headscarfed women, one middle-aged and one old (at least my age!). They unloaded their shopping from the trolley onto the moving belt and the woman at the till duly scanned them in and then said, ‘That will be sixty-eight pounds and forty-three pence please.’

I mentioned before that I was involved in an amazing project with some wonderful creative ladies, here in PEI. Today was the big day! Eight ladies combined our talents to create a concept wedding showcasing the beauty of winter in Prince Edward Island. It was cold (-22), blustery, and beautiful. A true winter wonderland!

Leaders are not only accountable for their actions, but also before their actions. Certainly, leaders should be willing to explain their actions after the fact. However, they also must be prudent enough to prevent morally inappropriate courses of action from ever presenting themselves in the first place.

I'll keep my eyes peeled for anything of interest.

This painting is truly painted in some of my favorite colors – metallic coppers, chromium green and indanthrone blue. The shapes were created with smooth beach stones from the Oregon coast, the largest shape being a 10 lb. stone (and the puddle of color in the stone’s impression on the paper took nearly 5 days to dry).

Nausea: It's been a wierd few days, and after the car panic, and some other stuff that is going on, I am a bit on edge. Julia and Heather got some gorgeous steaks for dinner, for a nice evening of grilling and chatting, and I was really looking forward to it. Then Bookhart came over and surprised me, which was WONDERFUL. I was feeling ready to chow down. But....Julia put that steak in front of me, and I could not even look at it. It was a gorgeous New York Strip, an inch and a half thick and cooked to perfection, and for some reason the smell of it made me want to hurl. I only ever avoid food when I am stressed, and for me to avoid steak? There is something seriously up. It was horrible. Nothing in the world could make me take a bite of the meat. I had to put it in the other room. It was the wierdest thing. That steak is still in the fridge, and it's calling out to me saying "EAT ME! Eat meeeee!!!" and I just can't. What is up with that?
After all, with he and Big Round Robot wreaking havoc all around, there should be an effort by the people under their feet to try and protect themselves.

The male mid-life crisis is a difficult subject to bring up around some people since it exists primarily as a physiological condition. Yes, us guys have to deal with such things like an unwanted horizontal expansion at the waistline or an accelerated retreat of the hairline we at least can exercise to fight the growing bulge or buy medicinal remedies to battle an asymmetrical war to keep something fuzzy on our heads. No, this is something that affects guys on a far deeper level, see I will be honest here and write something that should be self-evident, adult males never really grow up. Society, our jobs, and more importantly our wives may say we have to behave and act dignified and responsible but deep down most of us would like nothing better than tell the established social order to kiss our asses and fly off on some juvenile adventure.

Doctors, pah, what do they know?
I take a moment and reflect.
I know that everyone has their own trials in life, if not currently, they have had or will have. But how easy it is to look at complete strangers and imagine how “perfect” their lives must be in comparison to my own. I know from my own experience that a smile can do a pretty good job of concealing the mountain of hurt inside me. Certainly the same holds true for the rest of the world. Any showdown of resentment or jealousy that festers up toward the “happy, perfect people” is a waste of time and energy. Of what benefit is it to compare myself to others? God created us all uniquely and no two life experiences could possibly be the same. To utilize the worn out saying: It is comparing apples to oranges! It would be very, very easy to let the bitterness seep through my veins like a deadly poison. At times it is tempting to let go and collapse into a heap of defeat and self-pity, letting the waves take me under. It’s during these times of weakness that my spiritual survival instinct kicks in. I know to call out to Jesus. Without fail He rescues me and guides me back into the shallow waters. I’m surrendering, but I’m not giving up.

A pure punt of a purchase based on hours spent in HMV and Tower Records in Shinjuku and Shibuya at their countless listening posts sampling as much as was currently riding the Japan-o-charts, and it’s only really a mini-album, comprising seven tracks from this new indie group. But every track is superb, each different but just as good as the last. I look forward to whatever they do next.
‘That’s right.’ I smile. ‘How is she?’ I cough.
What is your favorite book?: This is a common answer, but I have to be honest. "To Kill a Mockingbird" is my all-time favorite book. I read it when I was about 12 or 13, which coincided with some key years in the Civil Rights movement. It's pitch-perfect in harmonizing writing, character and plot. I fell deeply in love with Atticus. I even imagined naming a son after him. But when the time came, even I couldn't saddle Atticus Buttry on an innocent baby. It's a book I still reread from time to time.
I wrote a few days ago about my creative self. I haven't slept much lately. I bought another magazine, Somerset's Digital Studio. I'm in BIG trouble now. I created this for a different challenge and 'lo and behold, it was 54 words. A little tweak and now it's fit for today as well. This 55 is less about the words and more about the hours I spent creating the digital piece, learning many new techniques ~ though it does serve as a journal entry of a recent weekend with New Beau.

4. Bring helpful friends/family. We all have a ‘shopping buddy’, that friend who will tell you exactly what she thinks of a dress. This is the friend to bring with you (if she’s a bridesmaid, if not it may get awkward), she’ll tell you the truth without being blinded by sentiment – no tears cloud this lady’s eyes. Your mum could be a saint or a sinner in the Bridal Lounge. I’ve seen mother’s tear their daughter’s dreams apart with one withered glance. Sometimes, as hard as it may be, it’s best to include friends and family only when you’ve decided on the gown. It’s your day after all, if you look and feel great in a dress, nothing should stop you from wearing it.

I had the privilege of being featured in some Asian magazines recently! Korean Vogue girl and Nylon Japan to be exact... The Vogue girl story featured a few bloggers and our favorite vintage items. I chose my vintage satchel that I ended up photographing in my kitchen... a selection of some of my favorite old jewellery including a feather bangle, that was a last summer find from Nice. A photo that did not make it to the mag was my kimonos that I expressed my love for before.. photographed next to my shoe wall.
Well, apart from my shameful lack of self-promotion over the last few days, anyway. I'm not actually being as petulant as that sounds, either. What I mean is, what would convince YOU to buy my book? I've sold 2 copies in the 17 days the book's been on sale, and I can't help thinking that even a brand new starting author should have managed a bit better than that.
My escape from the snow led me to the town of Seal Beach where I’ve spent s a couple of weeks puttering around, trying every restaurant and coffee shop in town. I also had a chance to see some more old friends. People from the pre-retirement days. It was great seeing them and great to be reminded once again that friendships will endure.
More interesting to me was the fact that 3 classes went to the small festival cinema in Mülheim, they walked down to the train station and caught a train into the BIG main station in Essen where they changed trains (presumably this meant getting all the kids off one train and onto the platform, going down a set of steps, through a subway to another set of steps and up onto another platform to catch the train out to Mülheim, 60 kids aged between 8 & 10 and 3 adults...I'm glad I only found out about this after the event.

He didn’t want to be there. Morning sunlight was struggling to penetrate the dust on the front window, but the shop was still dark. The place had been stripped bare. He couldn’t explain the shadows – there seemed to be corners where in fact there was nothing. All that was left was a huge counter running the length of the wall. He felt as if he were in a cave. A long, dark cave. With a counter in it.

And to my blogger colleagues, please forgive me for not reading nor commenting on your latest blogposts. I have had a couple of very busy weeks concerning my business.

It is 10:35pm. Spencer is still awake. He is so excited about "Mommy School," as he has named it, that he might end up sleeping in on the first day if he doesn't hurry up and go to sleep!

In new/adventurous situations, the mind joins the body in the present moment, present environment – all other thoughts and worries are driven out of the mind and it feels refreshed.
I already know this friend has a tendency to not like the same type of events I like.
“For (government officials) at this point to try and set back the clock would be a mistake,” said Phil Zimmerman, who created the popular encryption program PGP and who helped spearhead the successful fight against a similar law enforcement effort in the 1990s. “We would all oppose it and we would probably prevail.”
Dec 28th – just got a visit from the guy that I gave my Christmas money to keep him out of jail and he has been cleared of all charges. Praising God for the heart He gave me. A heart that doesn't pick and choose which Scripture to apply to my life because it's the "easy part". There's nothing easy about Matthew 25. I want to encourage you to do something today for someone without wanting anything in return.

Yapta describes themselves as “your amazing personal travel assistant.” They say their aim is to help travellers “get a better handle on pricing by providing easy-to-use tools and information that assures they get the best value from their travel spending.”
OK, so I am a nice girl. But I can get a little catty. I call those my “Reality TV moments.” I attribute my occasional z-snap to the sassy Real Housewives, my icy stare downs to the Kardashians, and my excessive cussing to the Jersey Shore. The moment I feel the need to share a saucy thought with a friend about someone else, I will stop myself and say, “This is real life. Your actions and words have actual consequences and will not results in higher ratings.” Done.
Now, of course, Tribunal seems to be doing a good job at keeping ragers at bay and tempering emotions in game. From what I can tell, and it’s hard to tell anything given Riot’s secrecy on this matter, no one or very few people have been permanently banned that did not “deserve” it in the sense that they did not smarten up. I’m not a fan of permanent bans when money is involved, as you can probably gather by now. Temporary bans are fine, but honestly, when money is involved, it just feels kind of wrong to flat out take the money and then ban the person in my humble opinion.
The really stupid thing is that I have insomnia.
Ignore your lawn – even if they look brown and unattractive, lawns do come back to life with a little bit of rain. Don’t cut your grass too short, and leave the clippings on the lawn to act as a mulch.

2007: Mary is accused of being a sexual predator and loses her job. She faces 3 years in State Prison. Johnny undergoes 5 years of therapy. Johnny’s parents sue the school for negligence and the teacher for emotional trauma and win both cases. Mary, jobless and indebted, commits suicide by jumping off of a tall building. When she lands, she hits a car and also damages a potted pot. The car’s owner and the plant’s owner sue Mary’s estate for destruction of property. They both win.
Just an FYI – the only thing that was not anticipated (by me) is that my Mom’s Kitty Tube is black. In the Amazon photos it looks more silvery-gray. But Mom & Ms. Kitty certainly aren’t complaining!

Here's how the house looks all put back together. Now to find the spot to hang it! This is nothing as cool and exciting as Clare's or Randy's honeybees, but it's as close to beekeeping as we will get. I hope the early spring Mason bees will help get our pear trees pollinated this year. I will be sure to post and let you all know how it goes.
A battle of wits rages between you and a higher power
I will be putting together care packages to send to our boys and girls. It really boosts their morale when they get them, plus they need really silly stuff like duct tape, carabiners, rubber bands, work gloves, batteries and lots and lots of toiletries.
I used to think I did not have time to exercise. Then I really thought about my online habits. I used to get up and check email and facebook, makeand read blog posts and generally surf around the internet for a while. It is amazing how much time we waste on line isn't it?
So I made a pot of coffee, grabbed my book, retrieved my glasses and took to my reading lounger on the porch, saying to myself ‘OK Amy, you get an hour, until it gets too hot, and then you must get back to finishing the report on your project they’ll be expecting next week.’ Well, after an hour and the first cup of coffee, I forced myself to break from the adventures of Ruth Reichl, the New York Times restaurant critic who entertains with her beguiling tales of disguises and delectables in the Manhattan restaurant scene. A pang of hunger finally hit me, after no supper last night and all these mouth watering food descriptions. I wondered how it had taken so long, actually. ‘OK Amy,’ I said to myself, ‘make yourself a Sunday breakfast, enjoy the next chapter and a bit more of the breeze as accompaniments and then hit the computer.’
I keep reminding myself that this will pass. We waited so long for her. This is just a little bump in the parenting road. I won't even remember it when I am watching her graduate college, get married or have her first baby. There is so much more ahead. This is nothing. I'll sleep when she gets older and doesn't need me to be there so much. Then, I will miss these days.
For those of you that may be interested, I'll be blogging about the belly over here.. There's one up at the moment, and the usual transmissions will resume here shortly, as I feel the block may be shifting.
I ended up making a pretty gourmet lunch today. It was mostly re-arranging some leftovers but it came together very nicely. The other day at the store I saw artichokes that looked really awesome. When I was a kid mom used to make artichokes for us and she taught us how to peel off the leaves one by one, dip them into a butter sauce and then pull them between your teeth for the one small bite that was at the base of each leaf. It's a lot of work, but it is worth it because it is so good. To make the artichoke, just put some water in a pan and steam the artichoke for 25-35 minutes or until the leaves pull off very easily. The butter sauce I did today was super simple, melted ghee (clarified butter) with balsamic vinegar and salt. Lemon juice is extraordinary with artichokes but I didn't have any lemons.
Dog: What was that? Did you hear that? Did you hear that? Did you hear that? Let’s go look. I’m going to look. What was I doing? Did you hear that? Oh, you’re getting up? Time for a walk? Is it time to eat? I have to pee.
Please don’t get me wrong: My obesity hasn’t prevented me from living a decently full life. But, yeah, I’ve missed out on things. Things I’ve wanted to do. And since I’ve lost some of the weight and started taking care of myself, so many cool “adventure” doors have been opened to me. Like that time I went skydiving.
By 1968 they were signed to London Records and had little success with their first single, "I", but did have minor success with "One Ring Jane" in 1969. Later that year they would form their own Duck Records distributed by Capitol Records where they released several more singles through 1970. Roger Law would eventually be replaced by his brother Les and the band managed to tour with the likes of Deep Purple, Alice Cooper, Cream, and The Yardbirds. Alas, fame eluded them and they split up in 1971.

The Vulcan Hotel in Adamstown looks like it is going to close its doors for the last time at the end of May this year. Its 3 year stay-of-execution is over and the bulldozers will be demolishing this historic piece of Cardiff to build another car park. Media Wales announced the story today and also has some celebrity endorsements of the pub. The BBC also run the story on their website.
I purchased her premiere magazine Lulu's which was choked full of great recipes and I need to order her cookbook to find the chipotle cream sauce recipe and purchase her chipotle taco seasoning to complete the recipe!!!!! Oh well, she knows how to sell her merchandise!
I talked Char’s ear off on the way to school this morning. She thinks I’ve finally gone over the deep end and I could see the look in her eyes, the wheels turning upstairs that said “She’s finally lost it!”
Although I was disappointed in the quality of the estimates (even after the preparatory work) what I took away from this is that all the students engaged in the activity, and the discussions I overheard were very encouraging. “what’s the formula for ….”, “how do you work out ….”, “what should we do here…”
Last year, at a Mamak stall (Indian muslim eatery) I ordered a Roti Ghee, and the roti maker was actually asking me to make sure I wanted Ghee, another lady thought he was asking her..quickly said, "No Ghee. I don't wan't goat fat."
The process is not simply one way. Leaves draw nutrients from the sun through photosynthesis. In this way, the public language reaches down into the roots. Just as the roots end at the leaves, the leaves end at the very tip of the roots. In this way the leaves sustain the roots. Without editing, the most individual aspects of private language would dry up. At the heart of private language lies a good deal of public language, necessarily. How does this deep interchange work? That's my next post.
Jonah Hex: Two-Gun Mojo #1 Aug 1993
The group had no ties to foreign terrorist organizations and the plot was not connected to the anniversary of the death of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, who was killed in a raid by U.S. forces a year ago, a U.S. Justice Department official said today.
“The Natural Heritage Trust —
As fast as technology has risen and as far as our world has run towards the future there’s still time to turn some things back—a u-turn. a soft suggestion, a counter-cultural move observed by others to show that some things shouldn’t change. We can publish words on the screen to gently suggest it’s time to return to Him, but only Jesus can heal what the world has shredded. Denial can only last so long before reality crushes us and makes us aware that there’s more to this world than nature or science, but a God that runs it all. He’s in control.
Having that extra day is known as an "intercalation." In the 1604 edition of the Book of Common Prayer was written: On every fourth year, the Sunday Letter leapeth." Hence, Leap Year. Nothing to do with Leaping the Broomstick or anything like that.

Martin McQuade is a consultant for Bing Crosby Enterprises. In 2002, he served as guest curator for Hofstra University’s conference, “Bing! And American Culture.” From 2003-2008 he assisted Crosby's widow Kathryn Crosby in the organization of several tributes honoring her husband, including the 2004 New York Public Library series, “Celebrating the Crosbys,” and the 2005 Film Society of Lincoln Center 14-film review, “What a Swell Party.” Martin McQuade’s mother was among the audience members during Bing Crosby’s first engagement at the Brooklyn Paramount in February 1932.

So....everybody was celebrating something. Now, the good news is that it was a big win for the Red Sox. (12-1) They haven't been getting a lot of wins so far this year, so any win is a good one. Although they have three in a row at this writing.
So much culture content... and the room is tidy too (at last). Win win.
"I need you! My feelings are so hurt!"
The cheering in the crowds has become robotic. They elected you and want to hear more than your stump lines and how the problems were there before you got there.
I am sadly too familiar with these tactics because they were used against the GOP ticket in 2008. The left seeks to single someone out and destroy his or her record and reputation and family using the media as a channel to dump handpicked and half-baked campaign opposition research on the public. The difference in 2008 was that I was largely unknown to the American public, so they had no way of differentiating between the lies and the truth. All of it came at them at once as “facts” about me. But Newt Gingrich is known to us – both the good and the bad.

My mom surprised me and told me that I got to pick a meal to celebrate my birthday and she'll pay. I went back and forth, back and forth. It took me two weeks to decide on California Grill only to see that I can't get a reservation. Fail. I really wanted to try something NEW but due to the schedule and difficulty with Disney transportation, I decided to do Boma (my 3rd time, mom's first) a day after my actual birthday.
“Nope. They are very similar. I figure if I am an illegal, and can’t speak English, I can’t comprehend what my customers are saying, and if I am Mrs Bates, I sure as hell don’t have any clue about anything. But I think I would look smashing with a wig and knife. So, I guess my mind is made up.”
There was a brief countdown and we were off! Running into a wooded area, initially on heavily-watered trail of mud and then very quickly off of the trail. Without a trail we had to dodge trees and logs and boulders, fighting the overgrowth while striding carefully enough to avoid injury. The uneven territory made for several runners falling very early in the race, tumbling or rolling their ankles (none seriously that I saw). My team of 9 was for the most part grouped together at this point and we made it through the first portion of the run (only a half mile or so) amidst a bunch of ‘Hoorah’s'! The first obstacle was Kiss of Mud:
Rackhouse - This was my local in Denver. The Rackhouse is in the same building as Stranahan's Colorado Whiskey. As you might expect, they are huge supporters of local breweries and local distilleries. They have a large cocktail menu that takes full advantage of the thriving Colorado micro-distillery movement to whip up some tempting treats. They feature 20 Colorado beers on tap and Chris does a good job of scooping up rarer kegs of brews like Avery Meph Addict and Russian River Sanctification. Be sure to ask about barrel aged beers that aren't on the menu as they have a habit of sending old Stanahan's Whiskey barrels to local breweries and getting kegs of whatever the brewery makes with them in return. Great Divide produces a Stranahan barrel aged, brettanomcyes doped version of Hades that is available exclusively at the Rackhouse. Food is reasonably priced and very tasty. They are famous for their mac and cheese, which is freaking awesome.
If you don't know what Glamping is, it's the recent term for glamorous(usually 'eco') camping holidays. Mention Glamping to a 'real man' and he gets insulted. It's like an offence, it's like giving Chuck Norris a manicure, or waxing Bert Reynolds chest, or even shaving Hugh Jackman's head oh, and perhaps his chest. lol What a waste. :)
I realized that each and every single adult in there was there willingly. And what struck me is that WE ALL KNOW BETTER. We KNOW we should not eat fast food junk. Even the salads at some of these places are loaded with hidden fat and sodium. We KNOW. So then…. WHY do we still do it? Why do we still think that eating at McDonald’s or Wendy’s or Burger King is a ‘treat’?

Truth be told, I actually have my own THAT friend. He’s gotten me into strange situations for the past 15 years. Car wrecks, dates with “special” girls, night I can’t even remember. It goes on and on. So, maybe all men have a THAT friend too. But I can only speak from my experience of women.
Two provinces down,the third,the biggest in terms of land mass and smallest in terms of population has fingers crossed for balkanization of the region. The level of intrigue and mystique surrounding the third province is interminable. News of bounty being announced for the death of Punjabis straying in Balochistan filters out now and then and people are gripped with fear. The media and other political parties,with PTI at the fore of it have endless capacity and breath to waste on spewing criticism at the government and every preceding government in the past,reinforcing the point that balkanization might indeed be the best solution. Give the Sardars their barren play ground. A province where every provincial assembly member is given an amount set in millions for development in their constituency,but still posts an abysmal income per capita of USD 183 (PKR- 16287) per year cannot blame the federal government for the insurgency and having an ‘apathetic’ attitude towards the province. Not when the Sardars are known for smuggling weaponry worth millions from across the border and run a thriving black market with the parliament’s blessings.

Sheik Yousef Al-Qaradhawi: The nation must rage in anger. It is told that Imam Al-Shafi’ said: “Whoever was angered and did not rage is a jackass.” We are not a nation of jackasses. We are not jackasses for riding, but lions that roar. We are lions that zealously protect their dens, and avenge affronts to their sanctities. We are not a nation of jackasses. We are a nation that should rage for the sake of Allah, His Prophet, and His book. We are the nation of Muhammad, and we must never accept the degradation of our religion.
Summer bees buzzed around me as I walked down the road today, I didn’t notice anything or anybody else. All I could hear was my own feet and the beating of my own heart. I heard my voice, not a mad voice!

You can even call 311. The hearing is Tuesday, 8/10. If you want to speak, you must register by Monday, August 9. All comments are due on or by August 10, the date of the hearing.
Heat olive oil in an extra large Dutch oven or stock pot. Add ground hot sausage and cook until slightly browned. Add chopped onion, celery, (fennel), garlic, touch of salt and pepper and saute over low heat for 5-7 minutes. Add remaining ingredients, heat through and simmer for 45 minutes. Add more broth and salt and pepper if needed. If you like more broth, add additional liquid, but we like it without too much. A few minutes before it is done, add kale and heat through. Simple, quick and oh so yummy.

Talking about Belle de Jour is going to be problematic, because my response to the film was a broader question that requires coverage of its own. So for the sake of clarity, I’m going to split this into two parts. The first is this piece about the movie. The second will be more of an open-ended thought piece on a certain type of French cinema from this era, a more ambiguous argument about context that’s admittedly a bit outside the scope of the film itself.
I’m not going to defend our guidelines any further, they are what they are and other people seem to understand how completely different the mechanics to our contest were in comparison to something such as WoW Factor. I’m genuinely surprised that Keelhaul didn’t acknowledge the reasons they would be the way they are. The part where I’m really confused is less than two minutes later he comes right out and says he really hasn’t “spent enough time checking it out.” Let’s just pause to see where we’re at:

I couldn't even go to the cemetery today in fear all of the snow would make it impossible to find her barely marked gravesite. Honestly, the very thought of her in the ground beneath all this snow is overwhelming. All I can think is, my baby is freezing. I know she is not, but, that is what I think. She should be in my warm arms, not in a cold grave.

For this project I will primarily focus on Character Design, but may develop some script or back story during the process.The character from the RPG will be the main protagonist from the story and the weapon designed will more than likely be a standard weapon of today such as a AK47 rifle or M4A1 Carbine rifle. It will be adjusted however to fit the story and it’s futuristic setting with weapon modifications etc. This will also apply to clothing and hairstyles on the character, I will need to consider that things may have changed for the character in the future setting than it would be in modern times.
Often great ideas.

I started my new blog series, Reader Questions, with a post on how to pick the right frame for artwork. Although I have privately answered hundreds of reader questions, with topics ranging from help designing a space to suggestions for cleaning hardwood floors, I have yet to answer many on the blog. With a number of projects in a stage of half-completion (including a play kitchen, basement plans and a frame for a DIY painting), I thought I would answer one of my most frequently asked questions: where did I get our ottoman?

As the morphine flowed into his bloodstream, the overwhelming supremacy of the pain radiating from the hard, grasping knot in his gut receded. It wasn’t that it had disappeared; at this stage of the cancer’s progress, where nearly all his body’s natural defences had been overwhelmed, that was too much to hope for. The general staff of doctors, their radiological battles lost and chemotherapeutic campaigns routed, had abandoned the fight, leaving the opiates to fight the last hopeless battles before his body finally raised the white flag of systemic surrender. But the pain retreated, becoming just one component of the reality which could be left behind in the distance as the morphine carried him away into dreams and memories …

So, what to do? Below, I have a set of simple rules to follow that will help. The thing that will help the most, however, is to be a good storyteller and a good performer–commit to your creepiness and don’t let up or break character. The more engrossed you are in the adventure, the more engrossed they will be. This doesn’t just go for horror games, but it is a place where it is especially important. Beyond that, you have the rules, as follows:
According to the site, it clocks in at 289 words and takes a minute to read.
In large heavy skillet, heat 1 tbs butter over moderate heat until foam subsides and into it drop half of crab mixture by tablespoons.
Caring should not be about the appearance of caring, it should be about achieving results. Genuinely believing that leaving people alone to do their own thing is a very moral perspective, maybe the most moral. Compassion for the poor and hungry comes more easily when you aren't paying huge taxes anyway. Designing social programmes that force other people to hand over their money so you can look good, may be a lot less moral.

No. 3 is a funny beast. I can remember it being described as a dark Bitter in the 1970's. I suppose that's no worse than mistaking its 19th-century incarnation for a Pale Ale, which some have. Burton, however odd that sounds for a beer brewed in Scotland, seems the best way to describe it. It shares many features with London KK and, when sold in London, filled the same slot on the bar. Of course, you could just call it a Scotch Ale, however confusing that phrase might be. Though, as you can see in the image to the right, that was what Younger themselves described it as.

My husband was never diagnosed as a psychopath but what else do you call someone who appears charming, witty and friendly in public and nasty, miserable and cruel behind closed doors. What other name is there for someone who acts like he has his “lid on tightly” to everyone in public and even as he closes the car door in front of all your friends or relatives, utters under his breath, “You fucken cunt, look what you made me do now” as he stamps on the gas pedal because he had an anxiety attack about looking someone in the eye again in case they could see through to him wishing them dead.

Once she finished molesting my life, we realized that stupidly, we didn't check the bag with all of our toiletries in it. So even though we could have fit it in the big bag we had previously checked, we didn't think about the fact that you can't bring all that shampoo, conditioner, etc. on a plane. You know, in case I made a Panteen Pro-V bomb or some shit like that. So we had to go back to the front gate to check the bag, go back through the body scanner for another nudey skeleton picture for creepy Joe in the back, and I got to be molested all over again by the odd looking TSA agent. Awesome.

After years of lying to myself, I came to the conclusion that I really needed to actually TRY to lose weight, to make lifestyle changes. I stopped drinking soda, stopped hitting the fast food joints when I was stuck in my car doing home visits, and would pack a lunch that wouldn’t spoil after being in my car all morning instead. I learned how to cook healthy meals for one and prepare food that I could put in the freezer and then heat up after long days at work when I didn’t feel like cooking when I got home. I STOPPED letting the excuse of my medication be my crutch to not lose weight and get healthy. I also decided to start getting back into working out. Here’s where this story starts to get good.

To blame any parent for this kind of tragic loss of a child is cruel. To single out smokers without evidence is wicked.
Kelly McGillis will always be one of my favorite leading ladies. My early cinematic crush has grown into a long-lived admiration for an actress who has endured a lot and still come out on top, in life if not on-screen. That said, I hope to see more of her in the movie theater and on TV in the years that come. Until then, we’ll always have Witness.

In the midst of media hoopla about another technology being laid to rest–namely the end of the space shuttle program–there was a lesser-told story in the news this week about the centenary of one of the more technologically engaged and provocative thinkers of recent years: Marshall McLuhan (1911-1980). Coming from a background in literature, McLuhan has exerted a significant influence over media studies for decades since his death in 1980. Adequate bios and overview of McLuhan and his work can be found here and here, and an interesting 1967 New York Times piece is here. Douglas Coupland (author of Generation X, Life After God, and Generation A) recently published his own quirky biography, Marshall McLuhan (see a review at the National Post, here).

Truth: Even if you’re not married and don’t have children, you should still consider whether you need life insurance. Others may still depend on you, such as parents, and life insurance can cover expenses such as funeral arrangements and potential debts, explains Blake.
My hormones are going insane. They are by far stronger than I have had in my previous pregnancy's. Not sure if this is b/c we started this process using hormone supplements and thus triggering my body to stay at a higher level or if it's just b/c every pregnancy is different, but either way I am feeling them. I have never been a crazy pregnant woman before so this is all new territory for me haha. Recognizing that my feelings can not be trusted has really helped in my day to day management of them, but it doesn't really help those feelings go away. I find myself irritable and weepy over the most ridiculous things. Thankfully I have more days of normal me than I do of crazy me and our summer is booking up fast so I'm sure the last 8 weeks will just fly by. I'm realizing that summer is a great time to be pregnant. Yes it's hot, but there is so much to do and so little time to dwell on the time that's ticking by. I'm hoping that before we all know it Ali and Ben will have their baby in their arms :)
Wand of Magic Missiles: I prefer this version of the wand more then later editions where they connect the power to the level of the person who made it. In this version the wand can fire 1 or 2 missiles a round at the users choice and each missile uses a charge. Quite useful at any level as in LL Magic Missile does 1d6+1 a missile and never misses so it can be used for some reliable damage while not being overpowered.
Genetic modifications engineered by Monsanto makes their products bigger and more aesthetically pleasing. Another, less discussed “improvement” is the plants’ ability to withstand nearly unlimited amounts of Roundup brand pesticides. This encourages farmers to use that brand of pesticides which is produced by … Monsanto.

With an issue as polarizing as “rights for homosexuals,” of course opinions run strong and deep on both sides. Count ESPN’s Rick Reilly as one of those with a strong and deep opinion against Brown and his activism. Reilly’s method of skewering Brown is a familiar one. Find an honor roll, all-American type student at Nebraska to use as an example and then paint Brown as a homophobic neanderthal:

You and only you can think and feel and know. You can create and form. You are so wonderful. You too can reach out and touch into the hearts and souls of others. You must be mindful of the power you possess to do this. And be ever watchful that you are only producing love. For yourself, to yourself and to others; all others.

I read Majestrum after reading The Spiral Labyrinth and Hespira, and I was a bit surprised to find it wasn’t the beginning of the Henghis Hapthorn story (although it works perfectly well as a standalone novel). Similarly, you mentioned earlier the Luff Imbry novel, which follows on from short stories and novellas. That’s quite an unusual approach, reminding me in a way of how indie bands like Stereolab and New Order would leave singles off their albums; it encourages a certain kind of fan. Was that approach the result of a deliberate decision, or is it just how it’s worked out?

Having said all of this, my conclusion is that precedent was set with the very institution of the Wild Card rule and that the rule that is currently in effect has absolutely NOTHING to do with setting one’s “qualification” for Worlds.. Therefore my conclusion is that USATF should simply disband the rule altogether as it really serves no useful purpose! And Merritt, or any other athlete should be the Wild Card pass that they earned when they finished first in the previous World Championships.

For those vegetarians and vegans out there, Brandan Brazier has written Thrive Foods: 200 Plant-Based Recipes for Peak Health ($20.00, Da Capo Press, softcover). It is also fairly idiotic in that he is so environmentally correct, the author discusses what foods use the least amount of natural resources to produce, require little “of our dwindling water supply, and cause a minimal amount of pollution.” Does any really care about such things when putting together the evening meal? Does it matter to anyone that farmers are probably more concerned about such things than you? They are not in the business of running up the water bill if Mother Nature will provide some rain. They are not in the business of polluting the food crops on which they depend. That said, there are some 200 recipes in this book, but you’d probably enjoy even tastier ones if you bought another cookbook. That brings me to Joanne Fluke’s Lake Eden Cookbook ($18.95, Kensington Publishing Corp). Fluke is best known for her mysteries featuring Minnesota bake shop owner Hannah Swensen. The cookbook is a compilation of recipes from mysteries and some vignettes involving the fictional Lake Eden characters. Fluke’s novels have names like “Cherry Cheesecake Murder” and “Key Lime Pie Murder.” All very entertaining for sure, particularly for fans of her novels, but the recipes are mouth-wateringly good and are mostly traditional favorites of every description cookies, cakes and pies. This one’s a keeper.
I tried to give a bit of a fur effect to the colouring of the rabbit using promarkers and prisma pencils. Not sure you can see it that clearly here but does look quite effective. Still need a bit more practice though. I am afraid the photo does not really show the lovely colours in the papers, lovely blues, greens, pinks and browns.

Speaking of fuel, that's another con. You'd use more and then you'd be ragging Mother Nature. However, if 80 is already common practise, surely it won't make a difference anyway?

I got the outline dug out last week and removed the sod … the hard part awaits the end of this humidity we’ve been having the last few days. At least I have been able to start stockpiling some concrete for it … close to half .. I think.
A very common thread, however, is that professors are becoming disillusioned by the lack of maturity of undergraduate students. This semester seems to be the worst, by my observation, for professors spelling out the rules that should be common sense. Cell phones must be completely off and cannot be out during class. Assignments must be turned in on time. Excuses that will be accepted for missed exams and assignments are very narrow. Extra credit is no longer being offered because of past abuses by previous classes.

This technique gives the mural depth (even if it's cartoony like the jungle mural). This is done by creating a sense of atmosphere. When you go outside and look at something far away, it actually looks bluer than objects that are close to you. This is because of all the "atmosphere" that is between you and the object. It's the same stuff that makes the sky look blue. You can play with the amounts; just know mixing the two colors will help you achieve dimension in your painting!

Compile strong stocks from a myriad of industries if you’re poising your portfolio for long-range, maximum yields. Even though the entire market averages good growth, not at all industries are constantly and simultaneously in expansion. Having positions across various sectors can help you capitalize on growth of the booming industries and make your entire portfolio grow. By re-balancing your portfolio, you lessen your losses in smaller sectors while taking positions in them during their next growth cycle.

There is nothing magical going on, as the author has opted to instead focus on the creatures and Steampunk technology, which appears aplenty towards the end. Overall, Soulless flowed well, but the middle was a little slow with the romance aspect taking a bit too much time to cement itself. There is plenty of action and witty dialogues along the way to things keep moving a pace. The dialogue and Alexia's own internal thoughts were the best aspect. I thought the properness of it all would grain on me after a time, but the author interjects so much humor that she averts that chasm to the point where I looked forward to having things made more formal again to appreciate the jokes and situations. There is a wide cast of characters many of which I would have liked to learn more about. With 2 more planned books I am sure some will end up better fleshed out. I especially loved the inclusion of the waxed face man and his associated mythology. It is one type of creature I think should get more used in Fantasy books, but is generally overlooked.

Some potential weaknesses of Spohn’s analysis are the following. In Spohn’s approach, the turbulent convection would have taken place in Io’s interior for over two billion years. In this time, Io’s interior properties would be likely to change due to the heat transferred to the surface and the amount of sulfur and silicate compounds deposited on the surface. It seems doubtful that the interior properties could support this type of convection for such a long time. Secondly, the time scale of the build up of the mantle hot spots, (or magma chambers) from Spohn’s model is only 10,000 years, yet the time frame of the orbital oscillations is on the order of 100 million years. These two phenomena should be related in some realistic way if tidal dissipation is the primary heat source in Io. Spohn also assumed a high temperature value at the beginning of the resonance period in Io’s history (2300 K). This high temperature would stem from radioactive decay in Io’s early history and a proposed period of greater tidal dissipation in the past as Io’s orbit was evolving into resonance. Considering other studies of heat from radioactive decay, from an evolutionary viewpoint, this temperature may be unrealistic. Most other studies of Io’s interior use temperatures of approximately 1500 or 1600 K.

Inspired by the children's book "Paddle-to-the-sea" by C. Holling, Adrienne Trent’s newest exhibition, Ground Classification: Without a Trace, sets up a poetic, and at the same time actual representation of a catastrophe. An ancient handmade canoe with large holes in the bottom becomes a survival kit/getaway vessel. The boat is packed with obsolete and some state-of-the-art equipment for survival against the elements (both natural and human created) and is oriented towards the St. Lawrence Seaway awaiting its imminent escape.
Although their comments are ridiculous, in my point of view, it is important to understand the underlying contributing factor(s) of their beliefs. Have our teachers and schools implanted the good moral percepts? emphasis on education and knowledge? How about their families? There are many possibilities but this is a warning signal to our government, teachers, and parents. Our labour force is unlikely to be able to compete with other advanced economy in the future, with the type of people we saw in the programme. Knowledge is power cannot be more true than ever.

Over the last 8 months, I have been completely amazed at God’s provision. Having a baby (let alone twins) was not in Steph and my plans. When we first found out that Steph was pregnant, we asked all the typical first time parent questions. How are we going to do this, where are we going to get that, when will we fit this in, and how will we do that? Deep down we knew that God would take care of everything, but we still had a tendency to wonder and ask those kinds of questions. We knew that God has a perfect track record in terms of taking care of His children, but still, how is parenting twins going to work for us? Have you ever been there before – wondering how God is going to come through? My guess is that you have and that as you look back on that experience, you are only reminded of God’s faithfulness and His incredible provision.

Horizontally integrated pubs are naturally going to focus on an efficient national procurement policy and offer the same brands throughout the chain. Whether the pubs focus on food or drink is all to do with what drives trade and where the profits and margins lie.

I admired Eve’s willingness to cut a bitch (i.e. Monica): “Micheal is missing. He may be dying. I am not in the mood for your shallow bullshit right now. If you get in my way, I will cut you, because you are nothing but a speed bump on my way to saving him. Are we clear?”
So, why this blog, you ask? Well, as I slowed down to handwrite some letters, I drifted into a very contemplative space. Lately, I’ve been working a lot on personal growth, and trying to figure out who I am after having gone through some pretty major life changes. Writing a letter afforded me that space. Unfortunately, those carefully penned letters went unanswered. Maybe it wasn’t such an unfortunate thing; I’m beginning to see the act of writing was reward enough itself.

Two years ago, I started running when my boss told me I had no place telling others how to eat better. I knew I had gotten a little heavy and was trying to lose it/tone up. To have someone point it out to me in the way he did literally put me in tears. The next day, I bought a Runner’s World Magazine and NEVER looked back. There is a dirt track by my home that is .67 miles around. Two years ago when I started running, I couldn’t run ONE LAP before I had to walk. In November, during my full marathon, I RAN 13.3 MILES before I needed to slow down. That’s a long way to come in two years.

Dear PEMRA, do you realize how vague and open to exploitation this definition is? What is an ‘impure thought’? Who is this ‘ordinary man’ by whom you will be (quantitatively or qualitatively?) measuring indecency, depravity and corruption? What about the views of an ‘ordinary woman’? Where is the list of ‘public moral’ standards? Do you see how you will be called out here for being sexist, preaching morality, using purposely vague terms to censor content, not to mention leaving yourself vulnerable to threats by right-wing nut jobs who will toss this definition in your face every time they deem something as causing ‘impure thoughts’? Are you ready to tell Mathira her show must be cancelled because she’s too sexy for TV? This needs to be removed entirely, or reworked by someone who is both gender sensitive and a legal expert who can drill down a usable, measurable definition of ‘indecent’ for you.

4. Now to cut your shapes for the tree itself. For this I used Fundamentals 1 cartridge and from the Flowers section I used image 4 together with the circle from the basic shapes on the left hand side tool bar. I cut the following sizes.

I think that's it, but it doesn't visit here very often. Overwhelmed visits quite often, but I think 'support' might be the antedote to overwhelmed. What's more its totally addictive. I can't stop organising support.
Academic historians are establishment ideologues not objective investigators. Starkey had “ Disgraced the academic world”, they claimed? The academic world has been in disgrace for a long time. The treatment of Dr James Watson after his "controversial" remarks stands out as a particularly strong sign of how institutions that are supposed to be about facts and truth have been promoting the orthodox ideology as in Communist countries. Rather than refute any of Watson's claims they attacked him personally, even suggesting he was going senile, and David Starkey's hero David Lammy criticised him ideologically, but not on factual grounds. This Nobel prize winner, co-discover of DNA was being insulted by semi-educated journalists. Now the same thing is happening to Starkey because broke the most important Establishment taboo. The 100 signatures mean nothing; facts to do not change because weak-minded and biased people want them to. The truth is not a democracy where you can collect signatures to decide what really went on. The signatories resort to assumptions:
I love Pablo Honey and The Bends for being pretty fantastic Britpop records. But OK Computer is the death knell and cumulation of the entire scene. It is at turns tuneful and oblique. There isn’t anything as beautiful as “Fake Plastic Trees”, as guitar perfect as “Just”, or as creepy as “Creep”. What it is, though, is strong, melodic compositions using a Beatlesque sensibility to create adventure.
I'm not sure what it is about birds, but I am fascinated by them. My husband has pointed out lately that there are birds decorating every room, I took that as a hint that they might not be his first choice of home decor.

Two recent schizophrenic experiences I've had recently. a) going to the darzi, and b) listening to grown men talk explicitly about their sexual experiences.
People in cars? You ever see those signs, big signs on the street that have a bright yellow background and picture of a person walking on them? Those are called "crosswalk signs" and in pretty much every state here in the U.S., they mean that the pedestrians trying to cross the road have the right of way.
Because like I said, you need an amazing amount of apples to make a small amount of cider, so we need all the help we can get! We’ve filled a few bottles for the freezer too. What fun! I doubt our family is immune to the stresses that every other family feels. We too worry about all sorts of things that other people are worrying about in this day and age, we get frusterated with our kids and each other. But there are times when we get to do something like this, that slows us down and makes us appreciate simple things, like cider, solid construction, each others company, and adds a little richness to our every day. And sometimes I think that’s what it’s all about. Adding that bit of beauty and richness into our daily lives, that makes it all worth living for. Cheers!

Tuesday: Corporate Tax Final (BLECK)
Well it is time again for Tuesday Tweets. I have been a little disappointed in that this meme has not really taken off. There are some really great people who have continued to support the meme and I am very grateful to them however I am contemplating expanding the meme to see if I can get some more participation.
I should be more accurate. They are temporary foreign workers (TFWs) to be precise, not immigrants per se, but as anyone in the immigration field will tell you there is noting more permanent than a temporary foreign worker.
So we walked down the stairs and piled into our 63 Rambler wagon and drove to Pittas on McDonald Avenue. We parked the Rambler in the back of the funeral parlor by the loading dock where they bring in the new customers. My Uncle Manuel made the sign of the cross when he got out of the car, although I never remembered seeing him
As a teen, I was always close to my dad. Mum always remarked, we were the same breed – selfish and arrogant (and ungrateful too, but she never said that).
What ever.
It was a lovely day. Our weather has been wet and cold but this weekend we had fabulously warm weather with a mild breeze that kept us cool along with the champagne!

Second half was a long journey so much so that Adi started complaining that she feels like being on the road for the whole day. Next stop was at a place where she played bowling, arcade games, won some 64 tickets and got a ring and tattoo as prize. When I agreed to let her play there she was shell shocked and asked “Mommy, why are you being so nice to me today?”, ”Is it because I helped you to cleanup yesterday?” **rolls eyes** I replied in an ek dum filmy style as “Anything for Adi”.. This is your day. Have fun.
I is important. So make it a priority.

When I left work in 2006 and took up writing seriously, I enrolled for a writing course at Coventry University. This was tremendously helpful and I made several good writing friends. I also joined a couple of online writers’ groups and a local writers’ group, all of which have been very supportive.
“I'm just going down south to pick some things up. I'll be back tomorrow. To pick up you and my hat. You be a good boy while I'm gone.” Geoff punched him playfully in the ribs.

It is bilingual. I homeschool him in Spanish so we used the Spanish side.
Aiki Combatives or Aikicom as I have dubbed it has elevated the interest of many martial artists, especially from ex- Aikidokas that took another route for the reasons I am expressing here. I don’t claim to be a founder of a new kick ass system, or Soke of this or that. Aikicom is simply my personal expression and interpretation of Aikido as a combat art, how it was originally intended to be. I am still in this journey of exploration and thrilled to have come this far.
9. Supreme Knowledge Domain
The course was through a housing area so the asphalt was great, but the path consisted of about 4 out and backs going up side streets, around a chair and back down. Coming up on the finishing chute I could hear someone on my heels and picked up the pace not to be passed. He picked it up too and we duked it out, but I stayed ahead of him and hit the chute first. I was moving so fast I couldn't slow down before crashing into the person in front of me, LOL. We laughed and thanked each other for the final kick. I didn't think I would win anything since the age groups were 10 year spans and I lost so much time in the second half, but I managed a 3rd place medal and got to walk to the front in my bare feet :-)

I couldn’t have said it better myself. Nor could I have more accurately summed up the core message of BreakPoint: The Christian worldview claims to explain and embrace all of reality. It makes hard-and-fast truth claims. And — as another one-time atheist, C. S. Lewis, argued — does not leave us the option of reducing Christ or the Bible to being “good moral teachers.”
Firstly- Evil Midwife from Hell- henceforth EMWFH
Much of my arting is all about the process…not so much the end result. The process is what settles my mind and my spirit. I usually have projects going that are more meditative than anything else.
The thing that I did wrong was that I did not talk to him about what he was doing. I did not confide in him anymore because I felt he would tell people-again. Communication broke down. I became his mother and told him what to do instead of being his wife. When this happened, there was no such thing as kindness. I became sharp. He was a sick man(which happened during our life together), and I lost patience with him after doing everything that I could to help him fix the problem-which was unfixable.

He also said that India should ratify a number of international treaties, including the Convention Against Torture and the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance.
Tonight, I was already to go and couldn't.
I searched for answers as I watched him with tear filled eyes. When will it all end. Is there any hope?
Also, I see an amazing potential for Reunion Pr0n* to spool out into The Whole Fucking Cycle of Deployment Woe Pr0n. We know all the little stressors won't be given fair air time - after all, it's not titillating to watch an Army spouse dealing with a bullshit job s/he only scored out of luck even though s/he is qualified for a real career-building position making more money and doling out less bollocks...not when there's hair-pulling and petty jealousy over who's running for the FRG board. Instead, little vignettes of "Awww, poor wifey is dealing with reintegration" will help civilians feel smug and warm-cockle-hearted because it's clear now the six month deployment was the fun part - the part wifey really enjoys. The cycle is so complex, I just don't see how a network show based on voyeurism and Oh No She Didn't moments could possibly convey the intricate and layered reality in 60 minutes with five or seven or whatever different families.
In terms of economic development and business recruiting, the general rule is the lower the property tax rate, the better. For companies with tens of millions of dollars invested in plants and equipment, even a very small difference in tax rates can have a significant financial impact. However, a closer analysis of the data provided by the NCACC shows some interesting points which we, as economic developers in Iredell County, can use to our competitive advantage when discussing tax rates:
What a mood-dampener. (har har)
Still think March is too early to start working with your child? I always advocate starting early and building a foundation at home. Maia and I already work on some of these concepts even though she's only 15 months old - although she doesn't even know we're 'working' yet! But I'm a teacher and I know what to expect for her first year (and those that follow.) I want to share with you too, so that your child can be prepared for an exciting and fun first year of school!
I’m not going to lie and say it didn’t hurt my feelings because it did. Rejection in dating reinforces the fact that no one wants you; nasty comments and bad reviews in writing remind you that you’re not any good at your supposed craft. I’ll not cry (much) about it though. I doubt Dan the troll will ever have anything nice to say no matter how well I write so there’s no need to get myself worked up. To coin an oft overused phrase, “Haters gonna hate.”
The parallels and disparities between videogames and movies are endlessly debated, but there's one certainty: they both return, routinely, to the architecture of New York City. The most frequently filmed city in the world is also the most frequently modeled.
And they are realizing that minimalist living could be what they are looking for.
My parents had apparently underestimated how traumatized I was by my first biking experience. They immediately went into damage-control mode. In a tone of voice that was so enthusiastic it was almost condescending, my dad said "How about I teach you how to ride your new bike, Allie?!" I buried my face in my mom's skirt and cried harder. "Well, do you want to go for a ride on my bike?" My dad continued. "You can sit on the bar while I pedal! It'll be fun!"
Dominic Strauss-Kahn also has a new apartment, and – as we’ve seen already – Murdoch’s New York Post is following every fetish and fart with avid interest. The Post’s latest ‘scoop’ is that DSK hasn’t hired any female cleaners for the flat; this follows hot on the heels of Newscorp’s world exclusive about what a lousy tipper the former IMF head is.
As we face the challenges before us, it is imperative that we trust each other, knowing that no matter how different our opinions or our styles or our decisions are, that we are united in our love and commitment to Jesus Christ. This will not be easy. There have been many reasons that trust has been broken in this presbytery. Feelings have been hurt, deeply. Relationships have been strained and broken. It will take a commitment from every member of the presbytery to take the bold steps of repentance when necessary, going the extra mile, and working through conflict. It will take stepping back and praying together when the going gets tough. And it will mean making room in our busy schedules to build community with each other.
His stomach rumbled. To Rainer's delight, it was rumbling in anticipation of food, not from dread of sickness. Outside in the courtyard a rooster crowed loudly against the faint counterpoint of bells from further down the valley. Rainer sighed and brought the bowl to his lips, chopsticks poised to do his clumsy bidding. He began to eat. The sun tracked up his legs. His chewing sounded loud to his ears. On his fourth swallow with no sign it was coming back up, the addict felt the stirrings of hope. It came to him then, as clear as the cerulean sky he glimpsed, that he need no more than the bowl of rice in his hands. All he need do was eat. Rainer ate in silence, and the way opened up before him, clear and bright.

Is it your job to pull it together?
Everything is made fresh to order on site and is an eclectic mix of American cuisine with some southern and Mexican influences. I should think around 80% of the menu is vegetarian and nearly all the dishes can be adapted to be gluten free or vegan too if required. I know some people think that vegetarian/vegan cuisine lacks interest and flavour, but there is nothing missing from these meals. Just take a look at the menu and you’ll see what I mean! I’ve never come across a restaurant serving food like this anywhere. I could have eaten here for breakfast, lunch and dinner throughout my stay in LA and still not tried everything I’d have liked on the menu.
On Christmas day, after an amazing lunch, I therefore enjoyed a nice Partagas P1 (see my review here) with my brother; I somewhat felt that wasn't enough for such a special day and therefore I doubled-up with a Montecristo Maravilla. While smoking, I got a little bit carried away with the Christmas spirit and therefore I took also a picture of the nativity representation my sister Francesca had prepared in the "lounge" :)
how big that bag is.
I'm sure this will be a popular theme this week at several challenges but here at MY SHERI CRAFTS, we would like you to create a card or project with a Thanksgiving or Thank You theme. Wait 'til you see all the wonderful inspiration the team has for you this week!
But for now, I feel like crying because I’m so scared.
March is hard.. I cannot believe its already March.. then comes April and then May comes to torture me once again. How the hell has it been three years already... May 19th.. Three effing years.. I can't wrap my head around it.. Its a punch in the gut when I hear that your 'friends' are being signed up for the pre-k programs and dance and all of the other fun things you should be doing.. It pisses me off that I still miss you so much, and not a damn thing can be done about it.. Sit in it and wallow.. pretend it doesn't hurt.. Pretend because obviously too much time has passed for me to talk about you openly. Its way too sad.. It pisses me off that you died..that you didn't even have a chance.. You had no chance..why didn't I know..why did I let them poke and prod you so much? It didn't save you, did it? It broke both of our hearts.. Drawing your blood all of the time didn't do much..having the feeding tube didn't do much either.. you still died.. I was told we had 6 weeks and you made it 2... you are still gone and I am still pissed.
l have missed my sewing machine sew much!!!
Honestly, though, to my great shock and surprise, the nausea caused by that 4 liters of vomitous bilious liquid I swallowed yesterday really held me over insofar as hunger goes. I was not even really hungry after the damn thing was over. But, Mom did offer to take me to Top Notch, and I'm never, ever going to turn that down, so I did have a nice cheeseburger afterwards.
Six months later the doctor met me on the street. “Why didn’t you come to see me about those fears you were having?” he asked.
It should be noted that there are a SHIT TON of stores on Rue de Passy, in the 16th arrondissement. Naturally, I didn't do them all. (Pffffff). I just did the ones that I, and most people I know, are likely to frequent:

True, there are a lot of questions and a lot more new ones may evolve over time. But, let’s take a step back. Eight years ago, when 19-year-old Mark Zuckerberg was building “TheFacebook” product, even he wasn’t aware that it would grow to be what it is today and perhaps much bigger in the future. He probably didn’t envision building a social networking site just to benefit mankind but had thoughts of making money off of it, as any youngster venturing out at that age would. It’s an undeniable fact that Facebook, as it is today is the result of investments and hard work from all those in line to gain from its IPO. There have been and are other companies in the same space that have not tasted similar success. Well deserved, indeed. And of course, scores of people like you and me are the reason FB is such a big success today.

The whole ordeal was expensive, exhausting, and time-consuming, but it feels good to call a goal accomplished. One of the more involved tasks on my bucket list is now crossed off, and I’m free to dive pretty much anywhere I want. I have plans to dive in Sweden this summer, but I also need to dive in Egypt, Southeast Asia, Madagascar, and the Great Barrier Reef. There’s a whole world to see and now I have access to substantially more of it. Now that’s something to celebrate.

This 50% bonus promotion is running until September 30, 2011, and Amtrak Guest Rewards points expire only after you go 36 months without purchasing any Amtrak tickets. That means you can take advantage of the bonus now and hold onto your points until you are ready to purchase a ticket any time over the next 3 years. The only downside of this promotion, if you can count that as one, is that tickets exchanged through points cannot earn points themselves. Nonetheless, the huge savings should more than make up for that small loss.

The most surprising part, though, is this new culture of being available 24/7. Skype IM, email, mobile… where have I been? Everyone else is so comfortable being totally available to anyone, at any hour. I am having a hard time embracing that. But I know I must.

Flipse said the combination of the two floral companies makes sense in today’s economy. By merging operations, they will reduce rent, electricity and insurance cost; and can share flower buyers and drivers to pick up imported flowers at Miami International Airport. They’ll also save on office operations such as accounting and human resources, he said.

The world Thoma has created is fascinating. A group of islands where water is a hot commodity, and suffering from parasitic diseases an everyday challenge. The ruling parasitic race, Gultur is wicked and insane. Though you don’t get a ton of face time with the bad guys there is plenty to suggest that they could care less about spilling blood in the name of their parasite. The descriptions and locales are vivid, and devastating from the fancy Gultur towers to the poor villages filled with people struggling to survive.

I have rather neglected Arthur Jeffress of late, but I will return to him soon. It has occurred to me that he has been too easily dismissed in various accounts relating either to Elvira’s trial or his place in London social and cultural life. As with Hugh Wade, he could do with a bit of a reappraisal .Fortunately, someone much better qualified than myself is currently working on that very project.

In reading Life Itself, Roger Ebert’s memoir, I admit to feeling a little frustrated at times about the level of information provided while at the same time recognizing Ebert’s intent to be open. I certainly wouldn’t want to read a tell-all, because I think the world is unfortunately losing its sense of privacy, but although his memoir forthrightly confronts some issues like alcoholism in the family and his own physical problems, it seems to skip over certain periods of his life.
As a natural consequence of this abundant time he had for self-exploration, Liam, while beautifully preserving his child-like nature, even at 13 years of age, is perceptive and wise beyond his years. He is thoughtful and has a self-understanding that I wish I had now, let alone when I was 13 years old and getting myself into all kinds of trouble over my lack of self-awareness and the desire to please others and fit in. He is generous and sees this world as a loving, giving place. He naturally fits into that as a loving, giving person himself.
State-controlled media portray China’s leaders as living by the austere Communist values they publicly espouse. But as scions of the political aristocracy carve out lucrative roles in business and embrace the trappings of wealth, their increasingly high profile is raising uncomfortable questions for a party that justifies its monopoly on power by pointing to its origins as a movement of workers and peasants.
As I reflect on the day together, the main reasons this was a truly blessed day, is because I am reminded that in these womyn friendships, there are layers of complexities....richness, and sometimes even challenges...however, when we embrace each other with our truth, genuine love, care and compassion, magic is created with each other...this is what I feel in the presence of these wonderful womyn friends. We share in each other our gifts of self and wisdom, we laugh, create, and commiserate
SO, I put on the scarf, and placed a pin on each end of the scarf where I wanted them to match up. I wanted it to be one flower longer on one side.
I have seen their widespread use at marketing conference, where marketing guys (and gals) like show other marketing guys (and gals) cool marketing stuff.

Now I know that some advise you to identify witnesses, but in the first few minutes after a shooting you may have other concerns on your mind. Also remember, you might identify a witness who you think saw everything and their statement reads, "I heard a shot, looked up and that guy in the green jacket (you) was shooting the dude that's dead." Wait, he didn't see the knife that was first pulled by the mugger?

If you’re ready to jump in (and I hope you are!), go ahead and create a blog, write your first post, and then come over to the Newbie Blogger Initiative H.Q. to sign up. There you can ask questions, talk to other bloggers, or bounce ideas off of new and old bloggers alike (not to mention the nifty banner).
Started early tonight. I don’t know if I’m gonna spit out one story, or go into a litany of different adventures. One of my many brain disorders besides the anxiety, depression, bipolarity, addiction and avoidant personality disorder, is that I always have a million things swirling around my brain at the same time. I used to say I had ADD or ADHD, but it’s not just that I have a short attention span. I don’t jump from topic to topic. They’re all in there together, getting in each other’s way, jumping up to say “Hey,” sometimes even merging together incestuously until I just look like a jumbled-up, crazy mess. That’s what you see from time to time.
The high-tech community contends that allowing laptops, PDAs and other unlicensed devices to operate in the so-called “white spaces” will revolutionize wireless broadband access. Broadcasters counter that such a move would interfere with television signals and distort TV picture quality for millions of Americans. A classic Washington clash of the titans, the fight between the broadcasters and the tech companies has turned savage, with each side accusing the other of distortion and greed.

Looking back on this season and looking ahead to 2010 the men's 400 has to be the new frontier - at least in sprinting. After all the 100 is pretty much on lock down with Usain Bolt (9.58), Tyson Gay (9.69) and Asafa Powell (9.72) all scheduled to compete in the new Diamond League - with every meet scheduled to have one or more of this troika competing.
Certainly it´s a charming book , full of fun, interesting and even sad stories, perfect for people that loves music and rock n roll or some historic facts that change our society. She was pretentious or phony(that´s a new word i´ve learned reading the book) flattering herself everytime , i felt her very sincere. At the end of the book there´s a part that´s so sad because it´s like a reflection of her past and how she has missed several friends and people around her and how she miss them a lot .

If all of that doesn’t convince you to watch BFF then I bet Queenetta (Q for short) could convince you. She is a fast-talking, super sassy 9 1/2 year old (that half matters, just ask Q) who lives in the same building as Lennon, Jess and Joe. Played by Daijia Owens, Q steals focus just about every time she is on screen. With her witty lines and delivery, Daijia is a force to be reckoned with.

News Outlets in Utah Decline to Reveal ‘Immigrant’ List
The idea of an Antichrist and Armagedon has always fascinated me. But I never thought about the reality of that actual scenario. The Left Behind books, even though classified as fiction, give me a believable picture of how it will happen and what life will really be like. And if so, I certainly don’t want to be left behind, as I have I stated in a previous blog!
Well, I ruled myself out after his first paragraph because although I could check most of the things he was looking for, because afterall, I am quite the catch and look 40 instead of 53 (Well, that’s what people tell me, seriously…and no, they aren’t blind….), but he was also looking for someone who was fit. Ok, not so fit. I mean, I need to lose some weight. I no longer weigh 108 pounds like I did just 10 years ago…Oh hell, try 15 years…ok, but my nickname was Minnie, as in Skinny Minnie, so I was living in Slenderville for most of my life. But, I now go to Healthplex, and zumba until I want to hit the instructor, but no, not so fit. But, I thought, I’m not looking anyway, remember, Vickie? But, I was sort of intrigued. I didn’t want to join Yahoo to get matched up with him, and I also didn’t want a profile on Yahoo personals..I mean, what the hell would I write? …….”Hi, I’m a 50-something, single, sarcastic, quick-witted retard, looking for someone with a pulse. Please reply.” Not going to happen. But, I was thinking…I should write to this guy…We sound like we have the same interests..I mean, I can hike…I like to write..I like photography…I like to travel…..Here I am, yahoo guy!!! So, I lost my mind and proceeded to think of a way to get in touch with him without joining Yahoo.

So, while he may have had a reasonable excuse, it doesn’t change the fact that he and his family continued to lack what they needed because he couldn’t see anything but his past loss. We have no excuse. We aren’t dealing with some unknown and unknowable foreign personality. God has demonstrated his desire and willingness to be known throughout history. We have His promises in the Bible of His loving care for us, and we have the record of His fulfillment in the Bible also. Any of us who have lived for Him also have our own experience in which we see God’s care if we can look beyond our past disappointments.
Dino TourFossil League: Dino Clash Championship
I'm a fan of The Copper Family, and John Roberts and Tony Barrand helped expose people to their repertoire of traditional songs. I recently found a nice thrift shop copy of Roberts & Barrand's 1971 album Spencer the Rover is Alive and Well, which is available on CD. I think I found this LP at the same time. Roberts or Barrand perform three of the tracks.
The cookies are done now, and crisp with golden brown edges. The pistachio and orange are delicious and light. The peppermint is a little less like a bitter Altoid but still have quite the minty edge to them. It evens out after a few bites, so you don't get overwhelmed, but it is still quite strong.

I’ve decided to switch gears for a change and talk about some of the more interesting stores I’ve been to in Nagoya. I’ve been talking only about Magic stores lately, but there are also people who come to Nagoya for quality anime and other hobby goods. Today I’ll be talking about two stores located in the Osu area:
It pained him that it was fully reciprocated in a way he never could.
Last week, my Tuesday was crazy. I had a meeting with the tourism office about making them a website. I taught a man how to make guacemole and tortillas which he will sell in his store. I played basketball, added a layer to a clay oven and worked on the newsletter I am writing for Peace Corps.

Helen Dawes (Mia Wasikowska) is a maid working at the same hotel as Albert. She falls madly in love with Joe Macken (Aaron Johnson), a poor young man who managed to fix the hotel’s heating. Joe dreams of leaving for America and wants to take Helen with him. He makes Helen go out on dates with Albert, who has quite a fancy for Helen, in order to get gifts that they could sell in order to buy tickets for their sea voyage. But as time goes on, we realize that Joe is just using Helen to his own advantage and to make their relationship worse, he gets her pregnant. This nullifies her chances of going with him to America and Albert offers his assistance in taking care of her and her baby, with a possible chance of marriage. The film shifts focus from Albert’s story to Helen’s, and we get the feeling that Albert is trapped by her existence and as a result of her earlier struggles in life, may never be able to start a life of her own.

I love books. I like the feel and smell of them. I never thought I would enjoy a Kindle but I do. Bound books still appeal to me and I do read them but Kindles are so portable, light and there is only one of them, not a growing accumulation on my shelves. Books are wonderful things to collect but I am in a downsizing state of mind. Traveling with a Kindle is wonderful. I used to travel with multiple books. What if I finished a current book while away from home? Heaven forbid I be without a new book! And what if I didn't like book "A"? Hence the need to pack both "A" and "B". Kindle had lightened my load considerably.

The next time I saw Marge was two years later. He was on crutches and looked like he had a stroke. His head had been cracked wide open from the base of the skull and circling across and round down to the ear. He was out of drag and had lost all sense or care of appearance. As he hadn't finally done me any damage I went over to gloat about testing negative and to ask how he was. He told me he had his skull fractured, that another addict who we both knew called Mick had walked up to him in the street and hit him in the head with a mallet. Marge had been in hospital for the past 8 weeks, was clean, though was scoring as he spoke. I kind of REALLY enjoyed knowing someone had done that to him. Had fucked him up for the rest of his days, permanently affected his head, speech, sight and walk. He was a dirty thieving cunt anyway, though it was harsh dues for that. Normally we just let it pass.

I love the love story! It's so much fun to watch it evolve. Eros is so entertaining, and at times he is pretty hilarious. (His friendship with Hermes is fantastic.) I also appreciated that it's a real love story and not just about lust - they really do love each other, and that fills me with all kinds of sparkles and warm feelings inside.

DUKE’s set which featured a band and two female back up singers was a breath of fresh air with a completely different genre. His soulful voice and catchy choruses were very upbeat and his energetic stage presence kept us entertained throughout. He often encouraged the audience to participate which made for a very enjoyable performance. DUKE has an official website and Twitter – @DukeOfficialUK
While no Malaysian will blame the police for arresting those who damaged police or public property, such as the single incident of half a dozen people badly damaging a police vehicle, there is absolutely no justification for them to threaten and beat up every person they found in yellow, even if they were participating in the rally earlier.
The cracks I’ve mentioned before finally split wide open. Puck plants a seed into Finn’s head about moving to LA and becoming his business partner for Puck’s pool cleaning business. Finn suggests that Rachel consider moving to California after they get married, a proposal which Rachel isn’t accepting of at all. She’s going to New York and she wants Finn to be there to help her through it. Finn then says something completely rational (which threw me off course) to her, asking Rachel whether she’s in love with him, or the guy she wants him to be. I’m pretty sure Rachel has always loved the latter, but nevertheless reveals the undeniable truth that these two shouldn’t get married or even be in a relationship at all.

I just got another heads-up from Stonetalon. First the basic information itself: Dontrag and Utvoch (of course) were making a scouting sweep around Battlescar Valley, doing a little followup on the skirmishes we’ve had there with Alliance forces, when they ran into another one of the faceless ones we’d found down around Thal’darak Grove. It must have been the runt of the faceless litter, because D&U were able to smack it down pretty easily, but they decided to have an extra look around the area. A rare non-retarded move by those two, I know. It happens.

We do not know what kind of formation their manager would go in for the finals. Will he go with Torres or Drogba or both? But irrespective of his decision, Didier Drogba, even if he comes from the bench could prove to be a huge threat. His physical structure and his finishing have always been feared by defenders world over. He is good in both the air as well as on the ground. He is someone a coach would always want to bring on for he always stands tall when the team needs him the most.
But one thing was peculiar. Even while it slowly grew up to the sunny blue sky, it never forgot its roots. It had the wisdom to keep growing its roots deeper and deeper in the mud.

Daily I wake up and start my day with fresh juices and my favorite, stinging nettle tea. Several days a week, I end the day with stinging nettle tea. For those that wonder, it tastes great and carries tons of health benefits! Stinging nettles treats inflammmation of the urinary tract, kidney gravel/stones and improves excretion of uric acid. Stinging nettle acts as a diuretic as well! This amazing herb is incredibly useful for myself due to it’s reduction of symptoms like gout and arthritis. I come from a family with a long history of gout and do everything to remain gout free!

The first thing we must do is look seriously at the warning. The writer of Hebrews is saying that if this group of people (the people mentioned in 4-6) fall away, it is impossible to renew them to repentance. Their fate is sealed and they cannot be saved again. The writer of Hebrews is not giving a, “saved, then lost, then saved…” theology that is so popular with many Arminians. To put it directly, if a Christian can lose his salvation, then he can never gain it back.

We did however have a hiccup when it came to my gift. Given that she's a mad Harry Potter fan, I bought two flights from Adelaide to Sydney to see the world wide tour of the Harry Potter exhibition.

For my first Harvie and Hudson purchase, I chose a pink button cuffed shirt and blue French cuffed (the Brits called these Turn Back cuffs) shirt with a contrasting white collar. Both shirts have a spread collar and fierce coloring, typifying the British look. Below you can see these shirts when paired with ties, also from Jermyn Street, to complete the look. The weight of the fabric is exceptional and after one wash, the shirts seem quite sturdy. This is is stark contrast to the dress shirts that I have from stores like H&M that feature thin cotton that have not held up well.

As usual, I’m gonna make a short analysis, trying to figure out how they got nominated. Liza Minnelli was probably the only lock for a nomination that year; she carries her film, Cabaret was a huge success both with the critics and the Academy and she had already won a Golden Globe for her performance; adding to it all: she was already an Oscar darling, being nominated 3 years before plus she was the daughter of their beloved Judy Garland, past nominee. From here on, I’m sure the voting was all over the place.

Quite frequently the moment somebody learns I'm an author they tell me "I have a story" and I always believe them because, frankly, everybody does. Today somebody told me a little story of something that had happened to them as a child. It wasn't horrific or violent or anything. Basically it was a small-minded mean-spirited thing that hurt the child. An extreme case of bullying. It got me thinking, what makes a person so mean and I became fascinated about creating a character based on what little knowledge I have of the person.

Becoming too much of a logical mind without using your intuition can be unproductive, but the same is also true with being too intuitive and not logical. Some of the greatest discoveries, inventions and creations of our times have been done by experts who were open to their intuitive side and responded to their hunches in a productive way.

Such data can be immensely powerful even when only gathered for a very narrow range of behaviour. For example, Amazon were able to roll out differential pricing of their products according to past customer behaviour. They were caught when some individuals deleted their browser cookies and discovered that the advertised price would change (no longer having had a reference point to the individual’s previous behaviour).

I’m way more confident in myself. It’s hard to stay confident before you’re published. You get rejected constantly so you can never be sure if you’re on the right track. All I know is I worked hard before publication to become the best writer I could and I continue to improve and grow. So I definitely see myself as a stronger writer and person thanks to all the things I’ve experienced since my first book.

I have a photograph of her, at age, looking at a photo of herself when she was young and beautiful. It hits my heart every time I see it. It is a reminder of what time does to us all and what it did to her, in particular. She was not happy during her last years and I, personally, suffered greatly for it. But I prefer to remember her when she was young and laughing.

I want to sleep not coordinate the world.
She would raise the chest whenever she was gifted with something, her eyes glancing at the interior wood of her Hope Chest. The inside of the chest, more then likely not finished, and complimenting that would be the scents that were also stored in this porous chest of hopeful happiness. The smell of the past from the lotion covered hands of your Great Grandma that were embedded into the fibers of the quilt that she hand made for you. These scents, mixed with what you and I may recognize today as carpeting in a hamster's cage, helped add to your dreams of happily ever after.
Naturally, Galileo is now invoked along with a reference to Creationism. Then we are told that "the intolerant Christian mobs that came to rule the late Roman Empire were in turn defeated and driven out of Alexandria by even more fanatical Muslim armies and rulers, who destroyed what little remained of classical civilization that the Christians had not already burned or banished". Again, we seem to be in some alternative universe's history here, since in the real world the naughty old Muslims actually took the Greek and Roman knowledge that had been preserved by wicked Byzantine and Nestorian monks and expanded on it, carrying it to Spain where it was eagerly embraced by Medieval Christian scholars and returned to the west. But that story is no fun at all. Pesky historians and their pesky facts and evidence ruin it for everyone.
Anna: Ah yes, the Kim Kyungho comparison is actually quite fitting for Cherry Filter even though I’ve always related them more to Jaurim myself.

Still, it’d be very interesting to see how they’d bre received by the audience.

Despite the dark nature of the plot, this young adult book is a jolly good read. The interactions and dialogue of the three girls is light and entertaining. Their spirited support of each other helps them through the good, the bad, and the scary. However, the girls’ interactions with the police, both the good cops and the bad cops don’t ring true. Still it is a good debut novel, suitable for tweens who like murder mysteries.

The first event I went to was the Balloon Glimmer on April 26th. The Glimmer showcases some of the balloons that are going to participate in the bigger Balloon Glow and the Balloon Race. Unfortunately, the evening was too windy for the balloons to inflate for the Glimmer. Even without the Glimmer taking place, walking around the Kroger Fest-a-Ville area was a fun evening. There were numerous options for carnival food, including red velvet funnel cake with cream cheese icing. There was also plenty of people watching to do especially around the small concert going on.

Despite the smaller than expected size, you get plenty of them to munch on and it is all about taste anyway. No one stopped eating Angel Delight because it looked like diarrhoea . Though I stopped eating these because of the distinct lack of Wispa taste. These taste just like the Twirl Bites and Giant Buttons, the only difference is the shape! A real Wispa bar has the hard shiny surface and the bubbly airy centre, these Bitsa Wispa are too condensed to offer the magnificence of the real deal. There is a slight airy sensation, but these are not the Bitsa Wispa we’re looking for.

Levi has been a trooper. This 5th series has been one of the worst. He's been extra fussy & needy. Yesterday he cried about anything & everything. He has been sleeping less & waking up seeming uncomfortable... which also adds to the fussiness from being overly tired. He's had a lot more noticeable mood swings. He goes from being too excitable to being completely drained (which maybe from the Tylenol & IB Pro). His fever has continued to spike higher than it did during the 3rd & 4th series of fevers. So just a lot more noticeable toll on his body this time around. Anyways - Today has already been a bit better. Still has the fever, but less whiney. He got a lot better sleep last night too... So that's what I know right now. We'll see what the Doc has to say tomorrow morning. I'll keep you posted...

The scallop circle was cut from Elegent Edges and I cut it in half and tucked it behind the ribbon and stamped Spring from one of my stamps. The flower was made from the Cuttlebug Quilling flower dies. It's the daisy one. I had fun making it and it was easy to do.

Nevertheless Cardinal Cooke’s call for volunteers to go out on the streets to fight pornography was met with an enthusiastic response. Led by Father Duffel of Sacred Heart Church and Father Rappelyea of Holy Cross with the strong backing of the McManus Democratic Club, groups of residents, largely the remnants of the old Irish community with a few younger professionals from the newer buildings, would go out every night to demonstrate against pornography on the streets, and at times confront the pimps and prostitutes and their customers. In a sense, not since the days of the Irish street gangs like the Gophers had their been such a fight for control of the streets of Hell’s Kitchen and certainly this one had much higher stakes—with the Catholic Church and groups like the McManus Club on one side and the pimps, prostitutes, pornographers along with the Colombo crime family on the other.

It’s a little cheesy in places and there were some parts that I sort of found a little unbelievable but this is not real life – it is a novel – and I found it very entertaining. I did feel a little cheated by the ending. This whole novel revolves around Jo and how she’s not quite all she seems. She goes to the retreat as a way to get close to Ned but whilst she’s there we see that she has some real issues of her own that she needs to deal with. I felt like that part of the story was glossed over a little. I know it’s not a deep and meaningful book but it seemed like we had the big reveal and then it wasn’t really addressed in a way I was satisfied with.
Obviously, the other major category this month was veterinary bills. To prepare for summer fleas, we restocked on Comfortis, purchased directly from my vet. I have found that my vet’s price on this is more competitive than the online pharmacies because they give one free dose with every six-pack purchased, and they frequently offer mail-in rebates ($10 off this time) that are only available for prescriptions purchased directly from veterinarians. Through my vet, it ends up being about $11.22 a dose for each 20 ~ 40 pound dog (compared to $15 / dose at Pet Meds or Drs. Foster and Smith).
While I'm excited to see that yes, people do love what I do, it devastates me to know that there is another mum without her beloved babe, another mum (or dad) experiencing the most devastating grief imagineable.
President Sarkozy has vowed to become a monk if he is voted out of office in May. I hope this is a subtle way of confirming that Carla Bruni will remain the first lady of France if he loses the election.

Bombed so much, the locals needed to find ways to deal with the damage. One product of the bombs was an enormous amount of broken crockery. With little else to do with it, they dumped it, often on the fields or the allotments.

Clever… for sure it is. But… what actually happens is that one is continually being bombarded with advertisements that, because of their intrusive nature, are now having very little effect.

From random tear-gas attacks on innocent children to sporadic electricity and water cuts in refugee camps, Palestine is a nation screaming to be saved from Israel’s oppression. The 8ft tall concrete wall that has been thrown up around the West Bank and Gaza to prevent those without a permit from leaving, stands as a physical reminder that Israel’s paranoia of the spread of Islamic fundamentalism has gone too far.
But, of course, our baptism is our ordination. For all of us. Or perhaps we might say that our Confirmation is our ordination.
Well, that is all of my Winter and Valentine's Day decor. All of this will stay up now until the end of February. I do keep up all the Valentine decorations because Feb. is Heart month and I do not decorate for St. Patrick's Day as there is not much time between Valentine's Day, St. Patrick's Day and Easter....

Perhaps when everyone knows that gods come down to Earth, we hallucinate gods; when all of us are familiar with demons, it’s incubi and succubi; when fairies are widely accepted, we see fairies; in an age of spiritualism, we encounter spirits; and when the old myths fade and we begin thinking that extraterrestrial beings are plausible, then that’s where our hypnogogic imagery tends.

And that’s another thing the Iberoamerican selection in both festivals have in common: about 90% of them will never be screened again in this country after their brief festival runs. Fortunately, both festivals have year-round programs that give these films another chance to find an audience: the Chicago Latino Film Festivals’ Film in the Park and Reel Club series and the Chicago International Film Festival’s International Screenings Program.
A short but steep climb takes me into Amberley village. I would like to take a look at Amberley Castle, dating from the 12th Century, but it’s a luxury hotel now and I suspect they won’t welcome me with half of Amberley Swamp clinging to my boots and trousers. More welcoming though is the Village Store, after a visit to which I’m happily munching on a locally made pastie, while making my way past gorgeous thatched cottages, looking so cosy and warm; meanwhile the rain tries its best to drown me.
Seems like we're getting behind on blogging. And for our what, 5 people that actually read this and check it regularly, we're sorry. It's been quite the adjustment getting used to my new schedule, which in turn has made Eric and Alli's schedule quite different too. We're also busy with trying to prepare for Christmas, mainly, the drive back to Ohio. I know we mentioned before that this is the first time we'll be driving back home for Christmas, and we're definitely excited. My mom has promised me the best gift ever... her waking up with Alli each morning and letting me sleep in. She's even going to let us use her brand new bedroom furniture, in her room upstairs, and sleep in the guest room while Alli sleeps in my old room, so we really won't hear her and can just get some rest. I think that's better than any Christmas present I could ask for, I am really looking forward to it. On the flip side, we have really slacked on decorating around here. I guess it's because we know we're leaving a week from tomorrow, and we'll be in Ohio for a week, so there was really no point in getting our house all decked out here when we won't be here to enjoy it. So, we have a tree, with lights, but no ornaments. It's the thought that counts, right? Alli and I were hanging out with our cul-de-sac friends this afternoon and their mom even mentioned to me, "What, Eric's not putting up all the lights this year??" We are usually the only house in the neighborhood to put up a bunch of lights... not this year. I feel like a bad Buddy Elf, I really do love Christmas. Next year, we're going all out again, I'll make sure of it.
I was fortunate to have visited two very beautiful cities here, Nuwara Eliya and Kandy with my wife and the trip meant we ended 2011 on a high. It is incredible that you can experience cold and warm climates just hours apart and this country has so many beautiful cultures and places to see. More than the wonderful sceneries, what got my attention was how different the people there were, from the people living in or near Colombo. Everyone seems ready to offer you some sort of help or curious to know what you are expecting of them. They are laid back and hardworking at the same time. Time seemed to slow for us when we were there. Even the supposedly dodgy train ride was an experience of a lifetime. I would go there over and over if I do get the chance. This is the kind of love hate relationship I am talking about.
I will admit that I have let up this year on the usual "cavalcade of junk" that makes my family room look like Santa's sleigh threw up....it's a smaller pile this year. As the boys get older the gifts seem to get smaller and more expensive and we have decidedly cinched the belts as well. Yo, we have a pool to pay off, right? Merry Christmas boys.
Tugendhat J granted the non-disclosure injunction substantially in the terms sought, except that he refused to prohibit disclosure of the bare facts that (i) SKA and PLM were in a relationship and that (ii) SKA is the father of PLM's shortly-expected twins. For the sake of clarity he stated that he was not ordering that any disclosure be made, nor was he authorising anyone to make that disclosure: he was just declining to prohibit it by an injunction. Regarding the twins, he added that, without having heard any evidence of submissions about the rights and interests of SKA's first family, or of the twins, he could not be satisfied that the claimants were likely to succeed in establishing that publication of the information in question to SKA's first family should not be allowed. This being so, an injunction was neither necessary nor proportionate.
Well, writing to me is passion, the passion to mark my words with something I feel deeply attached with. It is the passion that helps me in incorporating my thoughts in some identifiable shape which are otherwise always messed up. Writing is the passion which helps me deal with the situations in daily life. Writing- the passion to achieve the highest limit I can think of achieving to come out as a better person, a better interpreter. Writing is the passion for me to strive, struggle to reach that limit and then, set an even higher limit to achieve.

The state-run channel says it aims to bring viewers “another story”, one not told by the so-called mainstream media. In practice, this means bringing viewers the Russian state’s point of view. Let’s not forget how several years ago, Vladimir Putin, who is due to be inaugurated next week for a third presidential term, once “jokingly” praised former Israeli president Moshe Katsav for being a “strong man” because he “raped 10 women” (Katsav is now serving seven years in prison after being convicted of two counts of rape). “I never would have expected it of him,” Putin was reportedly caught saying off-mic during a meeting with then Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert when the allegations first came to light in 2006. “He has surprised us all,” Putin said. “We envy him!”

I always over cook the pasta. I happen to love over cooked brown rice pasta. But I reccomend you cook the pasta to your taste, strain and put it aside. In olive oil, saute the chopped fresh chives, and garlic. Add a sprinkling (or more) of sage, sliced mushrooms, and the smoked salmon, stirring over medium heat. Add white wine - I suggest starting small and adding more. Too much is too much, so go easy. As the white whine bubbles down, add the cooked pasta and fresh dill then stir until everything is coated.

Confession 4:
Mr. T was fooling with my phone. You have no idea the flood of anger, resentment, and betrayal that surged up in that instant. What? Did he not trust me? Did he think I was talking to other guys? And what if I was? It is not like we are married or anything. If I had guy friends (which at the moment I don’t) then that’s my business. Was he checking my text messages or calls or something?!

I try to make sure to have at least a couple cans of shaving cream on hand. There is something innately soothing about rubbing your hands in a fluffy mountain of shaving cream. When you rub it on the tops of your hands, it almost feels like a massage. No wonder so many children rub it on their arms, faces, hair, and bellies (oh, yes...I said bellies)!
In recent weeks, we've been discussing materialism in our family (well, maybe it's just me). Personally, I've been struggling quite a bit lately with the desire for material goods. I fully understand and embrace the fact that I am blessed with a comfortable life: home, car, job, physical comforts, relatively healthy family. We are better off than 90% (or higher) of the planet. But it's when I compare myself to the other 10% that I start to feel down. Why can't we have a house with a yard? Why can't we just pop out and buy a new car? Why can't we go on a nice vacation?

Instead, you will have to seek out alternative sources, such as this great backgrounder from the Australian Socialist Alternative news website, which makes the point that the $US 100 million pledged by Obama to help Haitians is less than 0.1 per cent of the 2010 budget to continue the occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan. This highlights the real priorities of American imperialism.

Believe nothing merely because you have been told it. Do not believe what your teacher tells you merely out of respect for the teacher.

The district pulled tens of thousands of pages of badge reports, e-mails and test security documentation. Data were sliced and diced (though not all of the data because the state refused to provide the district with additional requested data). Hundreds of employees were interviewed. While I understand the shortcomings of the KPMG investigation, I was personally present in a number of these interviews and in some instances, asked their questions myself. Yes, KPMG could have been more familiar with the school district context, but many of the questions were tough and direct. The interviewees felt the weight; they felt uncomfortable.
Although Blackbarony, Stanhope and Dawyck were rebuked for their failure to respond to the field preachings, most of the committee’s ire was directed against the earl of Tweeddale and lord Torphichen, for not informing them about the conventicles which had taken place between their estates.

One of my great whitely heroes is Daniel Defoe, who used various names for his books. His novels weren't actually published as novels at all; they were supposedly the autobiographies of Moll Flanders, Colonel Jack and other rakish adventurers. I envy the way that he could conceal his own identity so completely behind the voice of his narrator, hiding himself as entirely as the modern ghost-writers who give voice to pop stars and footballers, letting readers imagine that they're reading an honest autobiography.

The Forward also wrote that the baby’s death was not “attributed to their ritual circumcisers’ use” of MBP, as if that attribution was made in a vacuum. But it wasn’t. The death was “attributed” to MBP by the medical examiner who did an autopsy on the baby and who had complete access to the baby’s medical records. Further, that cause of death is backed by the state’s Department of Health and the city’s Department of Health.

Some tutorials I do simply to share techniques that work for me. Others, I write in order to force myself to expand my own knowledge. The latter is the case with an "Alpha Mask" tutorial that I hope to write. I'm more of a layer mask guy, so this whole "alpha" thing is not something I normally do. I decided to read up on alpha masks and then got distracted (as I am wont to do). Actually, distracted is not quite right. Burnt out from technical details is probably more like it.
The Isleys jumped right into a high energy medley of Love The One Your With and Listen to The Music. If this was a cover contest, Nazareth picked the wrong Holiday Inn to start talkin’ trash. Ronnie then took hold of Todd’s Hello It’s Me and wrapped it all around his soul. The opening word - Hello - Ronnie kept repeating it like he had been hypnotized. Thirty-seven times he said the word, and each time he caressed it a little differently, adding an inflection that kept this one word mantra fresh, made it seem like a totally different song than what Rundgren had written.

Joy started gymnastics!! Finally she is enrolled in a class! I have wanted this for her since she turned 3, which happened about the time Rob got a 10% pay cut at his old job. It is one of those things that I wanted for her. I want her to explore different options in life, like gymnastics and dance, maybe even a sport or two. Extracurricular classes are one of those things that I wanted as a child, and something I want for my child.

However i did like how historically accurate it was. It had the story of Lancelot and Guinevere and the ‘love’ story if you can call it that. For me it stayed pretty close to the original story. Some parts of the language were funny, but i think if i was younger i would have enjoyed it a lot more.

There’s no doubt this election is unlike any other election we’ve seen in more than a decade. The sudden exposure to real democracy may have some people confused. They are used to just voting by rote and ritual and a new way of thinking is almost too big and scary to comprehend. So, they are trying to tell the rest of us with open minds that we are doing something terribly fiendish by coming up with a creative solution.

I have a new home. A new address. A new zip code. I no longer refer to my parent's house as "home." In this house, I most recently have a new kitchen. Through my husband's and (some of) my own blood, sweat, and tears, we have remodeled our kitchen. It is now my favorite room of the house. Thanks honey! I read different blogs, and they always pay homage to their husbands and their tools. Well, the kitchen would not have been completed without him. (I will post with pictures soon.)

Now I've attempted the work and I have to say that there is the phantom of my third reason lingering in my head. The prose is hopped up, perfervid, and overdosed. There are entire passage in which it is nearly impossible to make out what Kerouac is trying to convey--and I get the suspicion if I could make it out, I probably wouldn't care for it any more than I do the surrounding prose I comprehend.

During the break all the teachers told me how much they liked the lemon bars. A success towards my goal - introducing new foods to the country, one dessert at a time! It is really fun to have them talk to me now and include me in their conversations (which sometimes means that one of them will have to translate). Nadia has mentioned everyday how much fun she had taking me to dummbalah!

The director, I'm told, was a one-time indie music video director, which thankfully didn't translate into an MTV-inspired mess.

Under our form of government the use of property and the making of contracts are normally matters of private and not of public concern. The general rule is that both shall be free of governmental interference. But neither property rights nor contract rights are absolute; for government cannot exist if the citizen may at will use his property to the detriment of his fellows, or exercise his freedom of contract to work them harm. Equally fundamental with the private right is that of the public to regulate it in the common interest.
Many thanks for making a documentary film on the Buddha, the Prince of Peace and Compassion. We would particularly like to thank the award-wining filmmaker David Grubin for making a film on such a matter of profound significance. We also understand the film is being aired by PBS – Public Broadcasting Service – on April 7th, 2010 with its nearly 360 member stations all over the United States of America and 110 million people through their local stations and nearly 19 million people online are expected to watch it.

Acid is necessary in preserving not only for flavor and texture, but in preventing bacterial growth. In making pickles, acid is an important part of the fermentation process. In fruit preserves, lemon juice is typically used as the acid, while vinegar is more common in vegetable preserves. Preserves made with low-acid foods must be processed in a pressure canner to prevent any bacteria from growing

This is simpler, yet more effective than most expert-driven methods in “international development.” None of his solutions were suggested by outsiders, nor evaluated, nor funded as a concept on its own. Funding goes into scholarships (the ultimate reward for individual performance) but the rest of the system is community and volunteer driven. It works because Gichuki builds upon solid foundations – by starting with the child, listening to the child, working with the school, orienting parents, and inviting community elders to participate in guiding the community’s children.

Even before privatization cranked into full gear here, it was tough finding motivated teachers - low pay didn't really compensate for the long hours, the many out-of-pocket expenses, and the largely inadequate facilities many teachers had in the New Orleans public schools pre-8-29-2005. The testing manias, the rage for TFA-ers over certified, diploma'd teachers, and the low pay plus little-to-no benefits make the atmosphere for motivated teachers even more stifling in the traditional public schools and the charters. A move towards Mavericks-style setups here in Louisiana would only work if the old GIGO was taken into account - that is, "garbage in-garbage out." From both the student end AND the teacher's end of the virtual classroom, if you throw garbage at each other, all that will come from it is a virtual landfill. The one-on-one via PC is not close to perfect unless embraced fully by both student and teacher...and I don't think we're even close to that situation in many of the traditional teacher-student relationships, much less the virtual ones.
Lastly came dessert! My weakness! (I love everything that’s bad for you!) It was a very hard choice at this stage as I could hardly breathe already so I had to make my choices count. I ended up with – mini fruit tart, mini macaron, egg tart (I don’t know why I included that in dessert), mini cakes (tiramisu, blueberry cheesecake & some others I’ve forgotten) & fruit (kiwi, rockmelon, honeydew melon). I halved all this with hubby of course – because if I didn’t I would have either wasted the half of everything on the plate or wasted some of the selection altogether. Also, I had sample bites of some of the flavoured ice cream on the stick. Some of the flavours included were melon, mango, coconut, durian. I liked melon the most.

The man behind pop/punk superstar group Osaka Popstar, singer John Cafiero, started the band as a way to unite his love of music and cartoons, not to mention the fact that it gave him the opportunity to play with some of punk rock's (and his) heroes. With Marky Ramone (of the Ramones) and Richard Hell (the Voidoids) on drums, Jerry Only (the Misfits) on bass, and Dez Cadena (Black Flag) and Ivan Julian (Richard Hell & the Voidoids) on guitars, Osaka Popstar released their debut album, fittingly titled Osaka Popstar and the American Legends of Punk, in 2006. Cafiero also worked closely with cartoonists and animators John Pound, Mari-chan, and Joel Veitch in developing the album art and the two music videos included on the record.
I recently reorganized my makeup and realized the almost disgusting amount of blush I have... I didn't realize I was a blush hoarder. That said, I've really been trying to use a bit of everything in my collection, starting with blushes that I love, but don't use enough. Peaceful is a peachy-pink blush with a fine glowing shimmer. The shade was exclusive to QVC, but may be available elsewhere by now.

September 29: The FDA ordered that labeling for the “ADHD” drug Strattera include a boxed warning about the increased risk of suicidal thinking in children and adolescents taking it.
I, for one, am thrilled it's Friday.
Anyway, I read this girl Alexi is going through a breakup. We all know how hard breakups are, so if you're going through one or are divinely happy in a relationship or stunningly single or sadly single, read this blog. It's fun. And maybe leave her some comments of cheerfulness and love cause lord knows having "it's called breakup because it's broken" is the most humiliating thing to have at your bedside, I'd rather hear it from real people!
The last few weeks I'm looking at more lace shawls and lace garments. One that has been on the list to knit for some time is the Triangular Summer Shawl seen here. I plan to hand spin Cormo and leave it undyed. Lace weight spinning is becoming my favorite lately so why not enjoy the spinning and knitting this beautiful shawl with my own handspun? The next is the Myrtle cardigan, and maybe the Batik pullover.

Absolutely! We had nighttime wetting here for a looooong time and just recently, Clay has been having issues with occasional wetting after being completely dry at night for well over a year. The GoodNites NiteLite Panel has been talking about bedtime routines and things you can do to enjoy some special bonding time with your child before bedtime.

We’re told over and over again that it is a “scientific fact” that homosexuals are born gay and therefore it’s clearly okay to be gay.
The Iraq protests were different from many of the revolts sweeping the Middle East and North Africa in that demonstrators were calling for reform, and not to get rid of the government. Their demands ranged from more electricity and jobs to ending corruption, reflecting a dissatisfaction with government that cuts across sectarian and class lines.
We're going to run with the apparent certainty of West Virginia's entry into the league again here. Vanderbilt heads to the ACC with UConn, Rutgers, Army, and Navy to round out their own mega-conference. Virginia Tech, Clemson and Florida State pack up their pigskins and head to greener pastures.
Today by special request,…..I have made a Magnolia card to share…….yes I know I have been a little neglectful on my blog with the old Maggie's……..but I can assure you it is not the case behind the scenes, as I am currently working on my projects for the next Magnolia Ink, so believe me when I say…..they are everywhere on my desk LOL……

Home advantage counted for nothing as Bayern Munich dumped host, Real Madrid out of the UEFA Champions League at the Santiago Bernebeu on penalties. The gruelling semi-final started with Khedira getting an early shot on target after being fed by Di Maria who went to the by-line and pushing a cut-back.
It’s a question worth asking yourself; and your answer might surprise you! Do Christians have the right to expect an agreeable agenda? I hardly think so, as my understanding of the Bible does not include promises that bad things will never happen. But what do you think? And how will you respond to your circumstances turning sour? Will you hand the events back to God and demand an easy way out…or will you thank Your Jesus for being there for you to rely on and for considering you worthy of enduring suffering?
And our lives have never been the same since!
So, we have our setting, our protagonist, and our emotional stake. What else do we need?

Robert Louis Stevenson was a Scottish writer born in 1850. He became a Victorian celebrity for publishing such works as The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Treasure Island, and Kidnapped. Stevenson grew up a sickly child that used his imagination to compose adventures stories even at a young age. As an adult, although his constitution was weak, Stevenson traveled around the world and used these travels as inspiration for his works. He died at the age of 44 in Samoa.

I took this one under a little better lighting conditions. I'm about 1/3 of the way done on the coloring. I have to work from the top left down to the bottom right so that I don't smear the colored pencil. It has a wax base so it will melt and make quite a mess if I lay my hand across it too long. I always like to see how the coloring really brings the image to life.
I'm planning on more subbing this week or certainly next.

Dark Shadows is Depp’s latest work, his eighth film with director Tim Burton. Based off the television series of the same name that ran from 1966-1971, Depp stars as Barnabas Collins, a man who’s cursed to be a vampire to suffer for all eternity.
Did I get too busy? Well, maybe; but school hasn't stopped me this drastically in the past. Did I stop liking fiber? NO. I still love the colors, the feel, the way it seems like magic when you make something out of it. I just didn't want to make anything out of it.

I will give you an example. Next time you are with a baby watch how the baby is alert and absorbing everything in their vicinity without judgement. Watch how they are looking in awe of everything around them. Take them outside. Place them under a tree and watch as they are completely captivated. When is the last time you REALLY looked at a tree, or on that note anything? If you look with your full being the experience is breathtaking. Our problem is that we mentally label everything. And once we label things we stop looking deeply. We lose depth in our perception of things. We look at the tree, and label it “tree” and don’t look again. We are missing all the beauty, magic, abundance, and life around us. If we live solely from the mind, life becomes dull.

Okay, I've heard this and frankly, I've had a very hard time believing it. I've tried quite a few brands and types of pencils and I have yet to find a pencils that would not blend. That includes watercolor pencils and your standard #2 graphite writing pencil my monster uses for school. I don't have any pencils manufactured in Mexico so I can't say for sure what the problem is with the people who have reported it. I know it has scared a few people. If you're concerned, try Derwent pencils. They're very proudly made in England and I've had great results with them.
Thank you for being so kind to me on my last post ~
I love Garaging (going to garage sales) and it's become addictive. For now it's on hold since we are closing on a new house (to us) in a week and a half and we are running out of space to store my "projects".

Do you set “rules” for yourself regarding how you mention your children and social media? What are they? Do you think it’s possible to gossip about your own kids? Or does gossip only apply to talking about those outside your family?
“Respect, renew, and refresh. Take time to rest and love the bodies that you are occupying for this physical experience you participate in. Too many times we see them abused or neglected. We wish to just remind you that there are many more experiences ahead. Live through them making the healthy choices that will enhance the journey of this life you have chosen. Doing so will allow you to focus on the sacred contract you have laid out for yourself with zest and focus.”

Today there were 2 charity rides. I could only do one and that pissed people off. I have to stay true to myself and do what I want to do. I refuse to have people dictate to me. The one I chose had 1500 riders. Two accidents, one bad. The bad one went down right behind me and I heard it and saw it. Lets just say that put a huge damper on the overlong run of 62 miles all around South Florida. Then I had to pull off and pee in middle of the ride when I realized that the ride was not ending anytime soon. Plus I was over the run by that point. When I tried to jump back in at the end after taking pictures the cops got nasty,wouldn't let me rejoin the group and threatened me. I got pissed and left.
"Hey, I've got to be true to me," he says.

While we weren’t haunted by ghosts, the night we stayed at the Shaffer one of the women that worked at the hotel was being stalked by an ex-boyfriend who threatened to shoot everyone inside. He drove by a couple times and the police were called. At one point, while eating in the restaurant, we were asked to step away from the front window. For a few minutes we drank our tea by the cash register, waiting to see which way things would go. But, in the end, there was no gunfire at the Shaffer that night, surely how Pop would prefer it.
The other bottle was something of a mystery. Port Jeff is a small brewpub on the north coast of Long Island. They have seven regular beers, but Cold North Wind barley wine isn't one of them. Richard didn't know if the bottle he got was new, aged or what: just that the proprietor was keen for him to have it.

I hadn't realized that raising the curtain between you and the show was the last thing they do...so not only was I was naked from the waist down in a room full of people, it really FELT like it. At least if the curtain had been there, I could have been in denial. Chris took pictures and I'm going to link to one of them, but warning it WOULD be graphic if my giant belly wasn't in the way. Actually, screw it, I'll just post it. It's that funny to me that I'll risk offending the majority of the reading public.
Cooking the tomatoes in the skillet (instead of just adding them raw) concentrates their flavour. They lose some water and become something really wonderful. If you wanted to, you could roast them in the oven instead, but why dirty another pan? Why turn on another appliance? There's no need for all of that. One tomato-ey bite lifted the fog from my brain and I was suddenly back among the living.

Recently I wanted to know the oldest functional temple in India. I tried to make some research but mostly I came across with the temples which were either tourist attractions or were in the cloud through its web sites. My curiosity has brought some results:
Regardless of what the grieving woman is wearing (come on, latex or not, it’s a pretty amazing look for a funeral), the intensity of her grief is so apparent. And boy, what a life those guys must have lived!

Last week I reached into the mailbox and pulled out something so Anti Me that I literally burst out laughing when I read it. Since it was received unsolicited and unexpectedly, I even checked the address on it to make sure it was delivered to the right house or was, perhaps, some asinine mass-mailer addressed to "Occupant".

There is a direct line from the anti-bourgeois, anti-nationalist, anti-colonialist anarcho-radical aspirations of Dadaism to Waste Land. But unlike so many post-Dada developments informed by it, Waste Land does not take that first fateful individualistic step that mostly tends to existential absurdity and despairing irony. In the film, recycling is a collective act in more than one sense of the word "collective". The associated labour process that reclaims materials previously designated as useless non-property entails the re-appropriation of these materials as useful. What is more, this transformation is from stuff not having use-value as privately owned property to stuff having use-value as collectively owned property. At the level of use-value, then, the art work is socialist property.
When I followed Weight Watchers, I learned that fiber was great. The more fiber you eat in something, the fewer points it had, which meant that you got to eat more. I liked that. I didn't care about much beyond that.
That is silly of me, especially considering the fact that I just mentioned how much sadness I have about all of this. I think one thing that I am really sad about is that I've stayed in such a situation for so long. I've put myself, and Myles, through hell. My self-esteem was so damaged and I had absolutely no self-love that I accepted things that were not acceptable.
Of course there’s plenty of folks out there who feel that the race isn’t like it used to be before the big cats came on board. But organizers believe they’ve largely avoided the potential problem of weather-related delays that could easily mess up broadcast schedules by switching to catamarans that can sail in a wide range of conditions. Races have been shortened to better fit into TV time slots and will be sailed close to shore.

“The latest weekly animal hygiene report of the Ministry of Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries introduces cases in which sterilizing work has not been properly carried out after vaccinations have been performed. If that’s true, there may be a connection with the latest infections. There’s a need to provide thorough sterilization once again,” Hiroomi Akashi, a professor of veterinary virology at the University of Tokyo said.
Krishnamurti: Wisdom is not in analysis. You suffer, and by analysis you try to find the cause; that is, you are analyzing a dead event, the cause that is already in the past. What you must do is find the cause of suffering in the very moment of suffering. By analyzing suffering you do not find the cause; you analyze only the cause of a particular act. Then you say, “I have understood the cause of that suffering.” But in reality you have only learned to avoid the suffering; you have not freed your mind from it. This process of accumulation, of learning through the analysis of a particular act, does not give wisdom. Wisdom arises only when the “I” consciousness, which is the creator, the cause of suffering, is dissolved. Am I making this difficult?

Anyway, people tend to work out what works for them, depending on their size, speed, talents...and we’re nothing if not adaptable. Some Sithe fight pretty dirty. I could introduce you to a guy called Cuthag. Not one of my favourite people.
Now we have Rosie, and now we have yet another style of training. So far, anyway--at least, in puppy kindergarten--the training has been all treat-training. We give treats for sit and treats for down and treats for wait and treats for this and treats for that, and we play the "drop it!" game in which we distract the pups from chewing on our socks and shoes and other contraband by scattering treats across the ground and merrily singing, "Drop it!" And ostensibly they abandon the sock and scramble after the treats and eventually they will abandon the sock on the command, no treats necessary.
My reluctance to perform in an ensemble also stemmed from watching the previous school concert when I was hosting it. Seeing how some of my juniors struggled on stage and not holding the instrument and the bow correctly, reminds me about myself.

We signed the boy up without consulting him, because I'm not sure he knows what soccer is by definition. He loves to play soccer with his brothers in the yard, and he loves watching the kids on the AYSO field play games as we drive by, so we took that as some sort of enthusiasm for the sport.

Now obviously having kids everywhere is going to be a constant reminder of why you’re trying to fight the disease, but the kids represent more than that. The lack of parents has left the kids to form a microcosm within the town, and they’re ignoring the stupid grown-ups and engaging in their very own politics and battles.

The law, explained for example in the CÉGEP de Saint-Laurent decision, is quite clear. Student associations do not have the same status as trade unions. They are not entitled to impose their “strike” votes on their members, as trade unions are. Students contract for education services, and pay, however little. They are entitled to have the classes they contract and pay for. They suffer great prejudice if they lose their semester. The protesters, on the other hand, can still protest if they feel like it, despite the injunctions.
Tuesday, 20 March: Tjokkie Venter (34), a farmer in the Harrismith district, was assaulted on the farm Uitvlugt by workers of a farm belonging to the South African National Roads Agency. He was stabbed in the face with a knife and hit on the head with an iron pipe.
He is one of those kids that loves to snuggle, thankfully even still at nine, and really LOVES to just talk. He says this to me all the time. "Let's talk Mom." As far as love languages go, he is quality time all the way.

Brown talks a big game on morals and personal character yet he is frequently shown up on these very characteristics. He, his staff and his government have been caught out countless times for lying and it is an ingrained characteristic of this Labour Government that they will only speak to their version of events, and their version of the truth. This is of course never an accurate reflection of real life, of the real situation, of the real statistics or experiences of people. In the conversation with Mrs Duffy today he was untruthful to her. When she asked what he was going to do about the debt he replied he would cut in in half in four years. The Labour policy as I have written about before is in fact not to cut debt in four years, but to cut the deficit in four years. A liar to the very end.

Could the 10 brothers have known what went on in Joseph's life after they sold him into slavery? Or if it had been written in Joseph's POV (first person), he couldn't have known the plotting of his brothers or their feelings afterward. By making it third person, we get a rounder picture of the entire story, but we don't have the warm, private picture of Joseph.

All you knew was that this music made you feel different from anyone you shared a locker with. Someone finally understood you. This is what music is about :.

Ok, for those of you who've never had dandelion bread before, which included me up until now, it's really tasty! After pouring the batter in the tin, I feared it might be too bitter, but the baking of it made that bitterness disappear. It turned out really nice, and I'm quite proud of this.

We all know the brilliant tracking shot that opens The Letter--how it finally comes to rest on a cockatoo, which flies off, startled, at the sound of the first shot from Bette Davis's gun. Another shot, the workers stir, then the camera moves in toward the plantation house and shows a man who clutches himself as he staggers down the steps, Bette Davis in pursuit as she empties her revolver into him, her face an impassive executioner's mask that each viewer must spend the rest of the movie interpreting.

Aside from accessibility, however, there are other attractions to these meets. For starters, they all have relay competition - and I love watching relays! Most meets have the traditional 4x1 and 4x4, but this early part of the season you can find lots of meets that run almost every kind of relay imaginable. Distance runners get to run relays with 4 x 800, distance medleys, and even 4 x 1600. Field event competitors too, with long jump, high jump, shot put, and discus relays (and others) where the marks of four competitors are totaled together to determine a team winner. It all leads to tremendous excitement.

The day started going down hill though, my mom had a rash, that kept getting worse, come to find out she had something that had some mushrooms in it, which she is allergic too. Somehow this wasn't on her chart, so they didn't know (GRRR) she was allergic. Thank goodness it isn't a life threatening allergy! They had been trying to treat it, but nothing was helping, so they decided she needed to go to the hospital. She has been there since Tues afternoon and is scheduled to be released today. The good is they changed the meds and the rash seems to be getting better, the bad, her blood pressure has been crazy high (which she has a problem for and is on meds) so they had a heart dr come in as well. They put a monitor on (she has issues with AFIB and in general caused the strokes in March) to keep a check, did an Echo etc, came back fine.

Dad was screaming disgustedly about goop coming out of them as he stomped on them and Mom was gesturing for me to come inside. I couldn’t move. I was frozen in my tracks. I couldn’t take one step forward, lest the goop “get” me or a caterpillar fell on my head. I literally think it took the better side of an hour to get me in the house. I nearly had a tantrum out of intense fear. I just knew that the one giant caterpillar over the door was going to flop off and touch me.

In a stand or electric mixer, beat butter and sugars until well combined. Add eggs and vanilla, beating until well combined. Place flour, baking soda, and salt into a large bowl. Add to wet ingredients along with cocoa powder, and chocolate chunks, slowly mixing until just combined. Drop dollops of frozen peanut butter into dough and turn mixer on for just a few turns of the mixer to get swirls of peanut butter through the dough. With a medium cookie scoop, scoop dough onto prepared baking sheet, about 1 inch apart from each other. Bake for 14 to 16 minutes, until cooked through.

Journalists Willem van der Berg and Pieter Steyn of Volksblad newspaper reported that the “suspended” ANC youth league leader Julius Malema, now elected as a senior member of the influential Limpopo ANC's executive committee, and thus more powerful than ever before, has launched into one of his by now world-infamous rampages against “white owned” mining houses and repeated his demands that all “white-owned” land must be confiscated.
John is baffled. "But dad, I moved out five years ago. In fact, this is the first time I've been back." He looks over at mother, who shrugs and says, "You know dear, your brother has his own business. He set up an accountancy firm."
“With eBay always looking at new ways to engage brands and retailers with the consumer, I’m sure we’ll see eBay’s UK site continue to outpace the average ecommerce growth in other countries. It’s a very exciting time to be an online retailer.”
Walls needed repainting big time. A combination of neglect (working in Gib), humidity, and dust, had left them looking very sad and dilapidated. Still, have painter as partner and it was all soon as good as new. Took less time to paint the walls than it did to sort the wretched papers, and dust off all the books.
DATE and TIMES: Saturday, May 26, 2012 from 9:30am-12:00pm
In my very first week of blogging, I posted that "work has been underway for six months now and several rooms are nearing completion". In retrospect, that comment lay somewhere between highly optimistic and slightly delusional. Eighteen months on, and with a greatly enhanced awareness of the realities of renovating, we are (finally) ready for our first Chambers Before & After (sincere thanks for your patience lovely readers!).
Hayes allegedly then picked up a tree branch and demanded the victim give them his belongings, saying, “Empty your pockets, white boy.”
One product is used to cut down on the hen house ammonia smell (something that could come in handy for backyard poultry owners) and another product protects chickens against fleas, mites, and lice. We haven’t had a problem with any of those pesky little critters to date but I think it’s more a matter of luck than anything else. The day will come and I’d rather be forearmed with knowledge than run around looking for sometime that might help.
I've been doing a lot of talk about goals, and I think it's about time I give myself some homework. I am going to learn a new song every day I have free time and post it online for the sole purpose of critique. I've been wanting to take lessons for singing, but I put those same mental roadblocks up that I rail against. This is the path of a detour.
Since planting my spuds, the rain hasn't stopped and rain isn't always a good thing. Especially if you grow on heavy clay.
So (thanks to your suggestions) we spent this weekend trying everything imaginable to coax this kid into position, including...
My oldest is at the dentist getting his first filling today.
“I’m curious to see where she is going next. I’d be the first one to call them and give them a heads up: Better get your affairs in order.”
If I had two ovens, this would be a moot point. One oven becomes the turkey oven, and all the other fixings can share space in the multi-purpose oven. Brilliant.

Vampire, shy at first, harrasses the children in his attempt to “play.” He hides under their beds and in the bushes. (Isn’t that cute?) He follows mother to the grocery store and then disguises himself as the cashier. But eventually, he endears himself to the whole family, hiding in closets upside-down to avoid his chores, allowing the children to push him around in a baby buggy, and even donning a frilly yellow bonnet and blue dress sewed for him by mother. The smiling milkman, making his delivery to the family, thoughtfully includes one jug of red liquid for them. “Look here,” says Sally. “One is for Dick. One is for Jane. One is for vampire.” And of course, a vampire is nothing without a love interest, even in a children’s book, so in the end, Dick and Jane drag vampire by his cape to a park bench to introduce him to their new friend…a pasty-faced hot chick in a black dress.
The turning point in your life is here.
We took her to the St. Patty's Day parade in Roanoke with some friends this past weekend and she was dancing up a storm! Every time a band would come by she'd show off her awesome dance moves. She absolutely loved the parade and waved to everyone as they walked by. She was especially excited about the horses and the group of dalmatians and grey hounds that were in the parade. She had a blast! (Pictures to come, they are currently stuck in my camera until I find my camera cord).
Others followed Hofstadter’s lead. Merle Curti in The Growth of American Thought argued that Social Darwinism “admirably suited the needs of the great captains of industry, who were crushing the little fellows when these vainly tried to compete with them.” Henry Steel Commager wrote in The American Mind that “Darwin and Spencer exercised such sovereignty over America as George III had never enjoyed.” And of course Robert Reich has said that Social Darwinism “offered a perfect moral justification for America’s Gilded Age, when robber barons controlled much of American industry, the gap between the rich and poor turned into a chasm, urban slums festered, and politicians were bought off by the wealthy. . . . The modern Conservative Movement has embraced Social Darwinism with no less fervor than it has condemned Darwinism.”
Yes I recognize this project is getting more and more ghetto. Don't judge.

We’re even less impressed with DAP’s unkept campaign promises and Pua’s pretentious acting as if everything is fine with DAP. DAP is a LIAR who cannot keep campaign promises meaning the 2 term limitless oligarchs shamelessly running a political party as a family business are at the centre of the b.s.. Again the obsession with people’s money rather than Dewan oriented or national issues like ending apartheid.

Thus, I approached AKB0048 with a view of at least finding one idol to approximate one of the least of Macross’ roster: Ranka Lee. The second episode showed me that the search would be challenging but not because all the candidates are of poor stuff. Conceptually at least, the AKB0048 roster of idols are necessarily awesome.
Michael Ritter is a fascinating character for his take on the East German experience of the newly unified Germany in 1992. It’s far more common to read of former East Germans who were terrorised and tortured, physically and / or psychologically, during this period of Germany’s history. Ritter, however, is proudly East German; he defends the GDR’s reputation and the means used to protect the country against its aggressors. Moreover, he’s disgusted by the blatant inequality caused by the influx of capital into East Germany.
This evening was a case in point; we skyped with my sister, and it became clear that my parents had been in touch with her by text and email during their visit here, sharing stories they thought were funny and which I just considered everyday happenings. The following story - which I was a part of - was told back to me, and blow me if it didn't seem a great deal funnier in the retelling than it had whilst I was in the middle of it*.
I work in a large building surrounded by an island of asphalt parking lot, and surrounded by more such buildings floating on asphalt. Somehow, over the months, I've learned to enjoy my walks around this building. It has almost become a time of meditation, and I always feel rejuventated. I often have insightful revelations during these walks if I allow myself to just relax and open up.
As Hannah Ryan waits for her family to return home from a camping trip, she realizes she has everything going for her—a husband other women admire, two charming teenage daughters, and a loving Christian home. As the sunny afternoon turns into twilight, her uneasiness grows along with the shadows. Then a car pulls into Hannah’s driveway, bringing two police officers...and devastating news that shatters her life forever.

It was the key. Not Czechoslovakia later on. It was Hungary. After that, I had no doubt about the fact that, with all the defects there were in the West, we still had to resist. So, my books were... I suppose today you mustn't use the words, "He was passionate"! Please! "Passionate" must never be used in anything you write about me! But I woke up about it. And I wanted to write detective stories which were fun, but translate them into espionage stories. I mean, obviously I was influenced by Le Carré, obviously I was influenced by Len Deighton, both of whom I thought wrote brilliantly – in their early phase. Le Carré's Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy is one of my favourite books.
When the people saw the thunder and lightning and heard the trumpet and saw the mountain in smoke, they trembled with fear. They stayed at a distance and said to Moses, “Speak to us yourself and we will listen. But do not have God speak to us or we will die.” (Exodus 20:18–19) Frankly, many Christians are way more comfortable with a God who is easygoing, calming, and smells like daffodils than we are with the God who thunders, commands and smells like smoke. We sing songs that say “In His presence, there is comfort…” and “I can hear the brush of angel’s wings” because “surely the presence of the Lord is in this place.” And there is nothing wrong with those songs. We do come into God’s presence with “confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way opened for us through the curtain, that is, his body” (Heb 10:19-20). But while Jesus provides the way into God’s presence, we must remember that God is the same God that shook the mountain.

My most loyal advertising customer was Frank Goldsmith, who ran the camera shop downtown on the square. I was introduced by my grandfather, who used to have a ladder store nearby. They were about the same age and both named Frank. Mr. Goldsmith even looked a little like Grandpa; tall, lean, with sharp features and wispy white hair. His camera shop was pretty typical. Although he sold cameras, his business was mostly film and other supplies. I don’t recall anyone else working there except Mrs. Goldsmith, whose name I now know was Vickie. In the back, Mr. Goldsmith had a peculiar collection of home movie cameras and projectors. My grandfather had a home movie camera that he probably got from Mr. Goldsmith.

My friend, Shawntele, at Rambling with Grace, has a new meme on Friday's called 5 Fave Friday. This week she is talking about comfort food, which I think is quite fitting with my memories of great grandma. These are the foods that I think about when I think about family and friends. They bring back memories of growing up. They make me think places I have been or places I want to go.
Heirloom Tomatoes can be enjoyed simply on a good whole grain or rustic bread, toasted. Drizzle the toast with good extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), cut thick slice of tomato with a serrated knife so as not to tear the meat of the tomato. Then drizzle again with the EVOO. Sprinkle with some dried basil. That's it. Enjoy.

I understand this is selfish of me. God has shown me several times that Lila is not only a blessing to Andrew and me, but also to our families and especially to those that watch her every week. So I will continue to work (honestly, I hope and PRAY it's not forever) and sometimes I'll be sad and sometimes I'll be selfish...but i'm thankful Lila is loved and is changing lives in a way I never expected a crazy, curly haired, stinky feet, sometimes dirty, bubble loving, happy, talkative two year old could.

From what we read of his personality it sounds like he'll be agreeable.

After a good rest and with food in our bellies, we started the descent towards Lingmell Gill. You would think that going down would be the easy part! I beg to differ! My legs were shaking that much I could hardly control them! It was extremely steep in parts! (I am such a wuss!)
Film photographs for me are snapshots of daily life, friends, feet, trying-to-finish-36-exposures shots, light leaks and a crazy lot of double exposures because I love them. You have to carefully compose your shot and be quick about it, and with that you get one snap. That one snap you treasure all the more.
But, the real point here is that on MY journey, in OUR story, I'm always learning, always open, always trying to be cognizant of my own shortcomings and proud of my accomplishments when it comes to my life and my family. In this case, I had a major, major shortcoming, a fatal flaw, and it had to be corrected. No more excuses, no more bullshit. I was backed into a corner that I prepared for myself and I had one option.
I like to talk a big game. I try to portray myself as a super Mom who doesn't take any flack from her three and a half year old, but it's time for me to come clean.

While there I was also fortunate enough to be invited to attend a seminar presented by George Riedel, who was on great form. I have always appreciated that good glassware can make a real difference to my appreciation of a wine, but have always been slightly sceptical view of the Riedel approach. I shall write it up properly as it was extremely interesting as well as entertaining and I was very impressed by Herr Riedel – and not only because I received a free set of Vinum XL tasting glasses!
The results are comical and somewhat humiliating. I can brush my hair, and my teeth, and put on most items of clothing. However, a bra is going to be tricky. For fun I tried on a sports bra one handed and it worked out ok- but it's amazing how much twisting and jiggling, and adjusting is necessary to make it fit properly with TWO working hands- much less one. I'm sure I would have won a "funniest video" award if it had been on tape...thank GOD it IS NOT on tape!

The other day at quilt group the conversation turned to the current rash of reality cooking shows, where people try to put on a good meal but are eliminated week by week. Now I don't know how you all feel, but I find shows like that are nasty; they are not about the recipes and cooking, but more about "who can we get rid of this week? If we chuck off so-and-so we might lose viewers because they are on the side of the poor dear, but on the other hand we can't chuck off those two nice young blokes because they give the females in our audience something to watch and we don't want to lose our female audience" etc. As you may have gathered if you have read this far - I don't watch them. Give me a good murder/mystery story any day, I don't mind a bit of gore. To judge by the murder rate there can't be many people left alive now in some of those little English villages, can there?

Episode 13 Recap:
Another way Lactantius depicts the philosophers as leading up to Christianity is by treating falsehood as a kind of world in its own right and the apprehension of falsehood as a separate matter from discerning truth. Then the pagan philosophers can be conceded to have done the easier task -- recognizing what is false -- without being able to find truth. This trope depends upon a reversal of classical predicates: now the false is evident and the true is hidden. Truth compels men with its essential force only when God releases it from concealment.

AFTER NEWS BROKE LAST WEEK that the much-maligned Brooklyn House of Detention on Atlantic Avenue in Boerum Hill would once again be loading up with prisoners, the McBrooklyn blog dug into the jail's history and came out with a list of escapes from the facility and other sordid details. Highlights include "horse-trainer, inn-owner, embezzler and sensational murderer Buddy Jacobson" who escaped with the help of "Tony Two Suits," and a riot in 1970 in which the prisoners took 26 hostages.

**Days of drinking + partying + eating chips and cookies = a disaster waiting to happen for my blood sugar. The irregular meals, snacks, and cocktails have already begun and I feel as though I’m becoming addicted to snacks. I’m one of those people that doesn’t understand the concept of portion control when it comes to the sweet and salty. Give me a box of cookies or crackers and I will eat the entire thing in one sitting. So, my general rule is that I just don’t keep those types of foods in the house and if I want a snack, I have to make one, which usually deters me.

I stood in the back throughout most of the service mainly hoping that I wasn't in the way, until the head of the Hibernians asked me to go up to the front of the church so that I could help supervise the filing out at the end. So I walked up the center aisle alone during the closing prayer while the Knights of Columbus flanked me, about twenty on each side, a bunch of old guys in full uniform and swords drawn. When I got to the front of the church I made sure not to trip or fall backward or anything because I knew everyone would see me but at the end of the service Cardinal Egan came up to me and said, "Thanks for coming."
Having a good selection of difference shop fittings will give you the flexibility to design your shop so that different types of goods can be rearranged quickly and presented in the best possible way.
The ravenous expanded-universe has since fleshed out the details of all the cantina inhabitants, providing back-stories and species-names for every character (and sucking some of the fun and mystery out of them as well). Snaggletooth, for example, has since been decreed a "Snivvian" named "Zutton". I don't know--I kind of like the monsterish and straightforward "Snaggletooth."

The consequences for non-compliance with U.S. laws overseas are severe and can include large monetary fines per violation for businesses, and similar monetary fines and imprisonment for individuals. On top of that, in cases of significant violations, the consequences can include a denial of future export privileges and federal contract debarment, which is particular onerous for cybersecurity companies dependent primarily on business from U.S. government contracts.

I'm obviously here as a beer fan. I want the beer to win. But on the basis of these two so far, I'm starting to wonder: is wine actually capable of matching with food at all? I'm so accustomed to looking for complementary flavours, I'm shocked by the boorish display of acidity here, too vulgar for an effective contrast. I adore these wines on their own, and resolve to stock up on them as soon as I can. But they need much bigger food than this to go with them. Even then, I'm not sure they would work. Is food and wine matching a myth?

In my humble opinion, the absolute best part of being military spouse (besides the discounts and commissary of course- I kid) is the amazing friendships I have made. Friends that have done everything for me from help move a dining room table, to watching my pups, to cooking me dinner when Paul is gone, to coming over when I had to call the police after my car was broken into (good times, good times). Any hour, any day, anything, my friends are there. There’s really no better feeling than knowing I still have people that are there for me when Paul can’t be.

In the past month or so, there have been things going on in my workplace that have left me... feeling unsure. Unsure about why I'm here, how long I can keep this going, and what the future holds for me. Over the past 9 months, I've tried to find my way. I've sought advice from friends, I've prayed a lot, I've found ways to set limits. Improvements have been made but my heart was still heavy with the stress I was constantly carrying. My Job was my number one stress day in and day out. I would do great for a couple of days and then the same-old, same-old would bring me back to Stressville. It was impacting my relationship with my kids, my husband, my friends. I didn't feel like myself but I couldn't figure out how to get back to the Liz I had been.

You can buy – more expensive – branded goods like “Body Glide” and they work just as well, and according to the labels are better than plain Vaseline. Personal preference really. Some theories about one reacting to cold and water worse but I’ve never noticed. You can even go as far as nipple covers or guards, small plasters, though these can move and come off. For ladies, good sports bras can really help. Decent running tops help as well – as the materials don’t rub as much.

If you are the host, it is polite to offer your guest a cup of coffee or tea before showing them out. If you are the guest, it is most polite not to over extend your stay. Leave as quickly as possible.
I actually wrote a whole page on how this makes me feel. Not going to bore you with that (and really I dont have the time), but this makes me furious. Not that she says dad needs help, he does (and Toast is actually out there doing what she asked as we speak), but its the assumption that he doesnt have anything else to do (which is not at all true, I cant fucking breathe because there is not enough time to get everything done), and that even if he does, he needs to do what she said because its more important. I mean seriously, can she not ask for help, does she always have to demand things?

But today we have a much worse scenario. Circumstances overwhelm many people. There is no where to turn and so a person may give up and take his own life. Committing suicide is not the best option.

A big beer week for Beer Blokes last week and the highlight was the Mountain Goat Beer Dinner at Beer Deluxe.
When Clockworx Gaming launched at the beginning of this year, we found ourself pushing our company beyond what we only hoped to dream. Since then, we have received conformations of over 200 followers. This would include our ClockworxGaming.com site, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, YouTube and all our other social media sites we are linked into. 5 months down the road, almost looking into a half a year now, we have had over a few thousand views, hits, and inquires regarding out posts, and we have you all to thank for that. But we struggle for more and need your help.

As a young girl I was known to get up in the middle of the night to tidy my room because I couldn’t get to sleep in all the mess.
The combination downzoning/upzoning in Park Slope gets a mention. Investment in transit will help the city "turn about 300 acres of rail yards, auto repair shops, and parking lots in the Midtown Manhattan area known as the Hudson Yards into a mixed-use commercial, residential, and hospitality district."
It's also true that none of the big-ish things I accomplished this year--self-publishing my novel, getting fit (and losing fifteen pounds), confessing long-held, unsaid feelings--had anything to do with New Year's resolutions. I did these things because I was genuinely, deeply compelled to do them, and that just doesn't come from the turning of a calendar page.

In respect of roadside screening, Section 6c of The Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003 (as found under Schedule 7 of the act) provides the Police with the power to administer a roadside drug screening test. Once the technology is available it is possible that the FIT may become obsolete.
Compared to these high-minded concerns, the questions at issue in the Québec case, Canada (Procureur général) c. Charbonneau, 2012 QCCS 1701, might be rather pedestrian. At least it does not appear from the judgment that the federal government or the RCMP are opposed, as a matter of principle or policy, to Québec’s inquiry into the shady dealings in its construction industry and that industry’s unsavoury links with the provincial government. (Might this change if the inquiry uncovers links between that industry and the federal government, as a report by the Globe & Mail suggests it well may ?) But given the sheer volume of the information it is asked for, the RCMP is probably concerned about the costs of complying with the request, as it is with preserving the secrecy of its inquiry methods and sources. The court, however, suggests that these concerns are overstated and/or capable of being addressed by the RCMP’s co-operation with the commission of inquiry and with provincial police. As for the constitutional position, the court holds that a commission of inquiry set up pursuant to provincial law can validly subpoena the RCMP and request information in its possession, so long as it does not inquire about the RCMP’s administration. The RCMP, as the Supreme Court has held, is not part of the civil service, and does not enjoy the same immunities from provincial inquiries as the federal Crown or its servants.
About Antony Gormley:
One of the earlier of the Brazilian metal bands I'd heard back in the day. The band def wasn't as heavy, fast or thrashing as Sepultura or as extreme as the likes of Sarcofago. I was drawn to this by the album cover art, and the fact that a review I'd read of it back then mentioned that it was an amateurish Brazilian sounding Iron Maiden. Anyone who knows me knows I've always been a Maiden freak. When I got this I was sorta bummed on the fact that it wasn't really that Maiden influenced. Only the vox really resemble that type of power metal(Maiden, Fates Warning), the music is more straight forward Speed metal(although some of the double leads might have the MaidenVibe). This one is Definitely not for for everyone who follows my blog. Its very metal, and has very little influence from any other realm.
We all enjoyed our meals, and I’m sure we’ll eventually make a return visit to the Rose & Crown Dining Room. For Disney in-park eats, this is a very reasonably priced sit-down – most entrees were in the mid-to high teens, with the most expensive item (the sirloin) topping out at $22.99. The venue is fun, and just listening to the server’s accents is worth the visit alone (I’m a sucker for a UK accent)!
The ICI integration into Holland’s AkzoNobel was far from painless. Within days of the merger, they were jettisoning some of ICI’s assets — such as its adhesives and electronic materials activities, which were sold to a German competitor. Some 29 factories, including several in the UK, were closed, eliminating 3,500 jobs.

I was introduced to this product by a representative at Sephora. It was during the winter, and I had patches of dry skin on my forehead no matter how much I moisturized! At the time, I thought that my clariasonic was exfoliating enough for my skin, however this wasn’t the case. It was suggested I use an exfoliating product once or twice a week to buff away that dead skin. The rep used one of these pads on my skin in the store, and my skin was left refreshed, and baby soft! I was sold!

Detective Black has figured out that apparently Kilmer’s superpowers only work when the victims can hear him…well, that’s stupid, considering that most of the other victims couldn’t hear him when they died!

We have had two wonderful weekends in a row, with sun and two-digit temperatures (speaking Centigrades!)
There was no other incident the rest of the night. Still, Olivia had a hard time sleeping. The other girls in the cellblock made noise all night, hollering and talking trash. The hard mat was so uncomfortable. Of course it was cold.
That cannot hold
This was one of those times where I wished I could have gone faster.

In conclusion, I learned to think outside the box when dealing with the elderly and their computers, I refrained from calling anyone a bastard, I kept the thermometers thoroughly clean, I prayed over green bananas and I taught someone who makes just a little bit more money than I do how to work the dishwasher.
As you should know by now this year's Afro Punk Festival has been indefinitely postponed due to Hurricane Irene, which is slated to hit late Saturday and all day Sunday.
The only sustainable way to escape this pressure cooker we call Earth without the deaths of untold hundreds of millions is to find somewhere else to go. Otherwise, the more of us there are, the less we matter. This isn’t a moral judgement , this isn’t apocalyptic doomsaying, this is math.
And Joan, were we having a three-way telephone conversation with Trafford? Where in I told them that the whole family knew you were writing this book for years? And that I was the one who encouraged you to write it in the first place? So why did you say that I told Trafford that I didn’t know you were writing it? Liar. – but that’s all you ever know how to do – LIE.

The info-session at New Paltz has greatly improved since I was there with Elsa in 2009. Our admissions representative, Alcia, was clear, thorough and confident. She used a power point to speak about New Paltz and made the school seem very appealing, desriable and flexible. The average grade of the admitted student is A-, sort of tough for us!

Many times writing for a blog obligates you to be current as much as possible...I like to be current and fresh when I can make that a spontaneous and gratifying act. My career is not well disciplined and I don't manage my time very well. I was in Brazil for a month, from end of August to almost end of September dealing with personal issues and little bit of work.

Thanks to everyone for their support this past year, I can't believe it's been a year of sharing God's word with all of you through these digi stamps. Thank you to my designers for the wonderful cards and projects you have made. I am truly thankful for all your creations.
While my sister was working for a professional cleaning company, she picked up an awesome cleaning tip from them. Instead of using a standard cleaning product, my sisters are now using laundry detergent to clean their bathroom sink and tub. Keep a small box of it handy under the sink (but away from the reach of little children) and sprinkle a bit onto a damp cloth. It works great for removing bathtub scum. Since it's much cheaper than the standard chemicals I'm switching too!
The children were interested in the way the seed split open for the plant to burst out. They thought it looked like a dragon throwing up.

There was a time, of course, when puerility as debased as this was confined to the playground, to be mercifully lost in the breeze after a few guffaws among half-wits. Nowadays, alas, the playground is known as the Internet. This stuff gets written down and enjoys a longevity vastly disproportionate to its merit, among people who park their minds in the gutter.
Today was the first day my body wouldn't quite allow itself to be pushed as it has been the previous four sessions, but given my lack of quality sleep, I was impressed with myself simply for showing up. Today we did forty-five second sets of various exercises, from arms, to legs, to abs, compounded by 45 seconds in between of active rest. I know that active rest is an effective way to make the most of a workout, but today, it was particularly difficult. Sit-ups (not so bad), thigh-knee-toe reaches (also not so bad), and scissor kicks (very, very bad indeed) are a sampling of the active rest Chad offered us My School District Boot Campers.
Here's a funny thing. Part of the plot of The Faceless is based on the story of the Accrington Pals, who were wiped out on the first day of the Battle of the Somme: 1st July, 1916. As you can imagine, this and related subjects have been on my mind a lot over the course of the year as I pulled this monster together. But at last, so I thought, I could forget all about it.
I have made a few cards this week with stamps I bought recently from *whisper* QVC. I dont really buy off them often as they are expensive and when I do see something nice I wish I could buy just one or two - who needs 20 or 30 sheets of the same thing! Anyhoo, I thought that these stamps were lovely and being large, even I could colour them in. lol. I have used 7gypsies and echo park papers and a lovely new frame nestie. I've kept the cards quite simple. Hope you like K x

A little while ago Peter, Abby, and I headed up to Alexandria, VA to help Julie move into her new place. Well, Peter helped and I helped Abby stay out of the way and occupied her on the swing and chased around the cat, plus two diaper changes in the back of the Prius. Groovy and the Dynamic Darlene were there as well to assist. It’s a cute lil’ apartment and I’m sure Julie and Betsy kitty will feel right at home very soon. There’s so much to do around the DC/NOVA area and we plan to see Julie so much more now – that is the best part of all of this. Julie and I are on the hunt for a good concert to attend in the area but so far we’ve only come across Marilyn Manson or Michael Bolton. It’s a shame that Manson isn’t the opening act for Bolton. That would be the ultimate concert experience.
According to Kenneth Anger´s “Lucifer Rising” and inspired by the Externsteine I created a video to one of my songs called “Given.”
Di has a blog that really does deserve this award! I came across Di's blog and loved it so much that I started to read all her past posts. Di has an Etsy store, and has for sale some fantastic items. On one post was a selection of pewter hunting themed lapel pins that Di had purchased at auction, so I left a comment about how much I loved the fox pin. Di contacted me to say that she still had the pin and would love me to have it. A parcel arrived with not only the fox pin inside, but another charming pin with pheasants on, and all beautifully wrapped too. To receive a gift from someone who I had just left a comment for, shows what a generous and kind hearted person Di is.... and she is so much more too :)

Such signs of a robust and growing community don't mesh with national Islamist activists who depict Muslims as under siege. On the other hand, those groups routinely smear Muslim voices who proclaim loudest that America is the best place for a Muslim to practice his/her faith.

I’ve heard the excuse of the MTA— the state funding is lacking. All New York State and City agencies have felt the crunch. But the reality is that the MTA’s financial picture is what it is because of the bloated and wasteful spending of the agency itself. This is the same agency that sells-off land underpriced to wealthy developers while laying off their municipal workers. New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli reported earlier this year that MTA overtime costs soared 26% between 2005 and 2009, nearly $3M more than anticipated this year alone. MTA overall spending has grown at an average annual rate of 7% during the past five years, more than twice the rate of inflation. The MTA’s outstanding debt totals about $27.5B, 54% higher than it was five years ago. The MTA Real Estate Taxes are coming in short by $105M. The MTA Payroll Mobility Tax will be over $200M short of projected returns by the end of the year. These muddled numbers and others leave you with an $800 million deficit— a deficit that seems to steadily increase. And recently, Moody’s reduced the rating on the MTA’s transportation revenue bonds to A3, the fourth-lowest investment grade.
When I parked my car and opened the door, there on the ground was a banking envelope, you know for the ATM, unsealed with cash in it! There was only one other car beside me. I picked it up, walked in and started to ask if anyone lost a banking envelope from TD.
Having several positive home pregnancy tests. Taken a blood test and having positive results. At this point, I would suggest to make an appointment with the gynecologist where you will be given confirmation of the test results along with your first sonogram. Some clinics will not offer a sonogram during early pregnancy. Some require that you are at sonogram. least two months pregnant before performing a sono on you because of the high risks of having a miscarriage. Since most miscarriages happen during the first two months of pregnancy . It would just be more emotionally harder for the mother after seeing their baby on the monitor or picture of a sonogram.

One of my favorite areas to teach is writing. I think that a student's writing truly shows the growth over a year. I know that in the past, I have always enjoyed going back to my childhood scrapbooks and seeing just what I was like as a child. Since I began my first year of teaching, I have always wanted to create this same experience for my students. Every year, I keep all of the writings that we complete in a big Rubbermaid container. Then, at the end of the year, we pull that container out and we sort through the students writing. This has definitely become one of our favorite days of the year. I love hearing the students reflect on all of their learning through the year and it always makes them so proud of their accomplishments. I love the fact that I can send my students into their next school year as proud and CONDIFENDENT writers.

Autumn 1967
Your average Territory cattle grazier is deeply concerned about how his or her livestock is treated. All farmers with cattle care about their livestock and take pains to make sure that the animals are as happy as possible. But how to get this message across into the metro media, the place that conditions government responses to issues that arise from time to time in the public sphere? This is the challenge. It's not easy, but it's not impossible either. I wrote this post in the hope that it can help farmers to understand the dynamics of the metro media, from the point of view of a freelance journalist. A lot of metro news outfits do not take freelance stories now due to the difficult economic times newspapers are facing. But that doesn't mean that you can't get your message across. For many newspapers, staff journalists are in constant contact with public relations operatives (PRs), who send them story ideas in the same way that a freelancer will pitch a story to editors and journalists working for a news vehicle.
Regrettably, through a process that still cries out for explanation, Quatro became worse than any prison that even the apartheid regime - itself considered a crime against humanity - had ever had.
Day 13- Favorite poet
In 1968, racial tensions were palpable as the Civil Rights movement rallied and mobilized Americans supporting an end to the blatant racial atrocities of the day. More and more, the journalistic media began to air the footage to support getting the word out about the many realities and inequities on how Blacks were viewed, treated, and kept in their place in America. Maryland lies at the Mason-Dixon line between the North and South, and its history reflects the turmoil wrought out of the bigotry and Jim Crow law no longer legal, but hard to change as human behavioral change growth is most difficult when anchored in resistance. My mother gave me clear and detailed directions about riding the public bus for the first time out of my neighborhood into an all-white part of the City. Her protective clarity and warnings about what I might encounter scared me, though I was a very tall, large, and confident girl who had not feared people or places before. I struggled to digest why anyone would want to harm me, but against the backdrop of the television news shows, I soon realized that Negroes are not safe when travelling alone. As a working woman and single mother, my mother could not afford to accompany me to the large junior high school where school testing was provided. I arrived at the school of four wing locations after walking alone from the bus stop, which let me off about a quarter-mile from the school. I walked alone quickly speaking to no one, and soon arrived on campus confused about which entrance to enter. After two failed attempts, I approached a caucasian woman just arriving on the parking lot and asked about where to find the school testing entrance. She turned out to be the school psychologist who would conduct the testing, and I walked with her into the school. She was nice, talking comfortably with me – she felt safe to me. I liked her and soon was not afraid anymore. Taking the time to explain the testing and timeframes with me, I started the varied aspects of testing. There was a comfort in knowing that test items were not difficult for me, and I completed all sections before the alloted test period ended. I would return in two weeks for results and a discussion of my placement recommendations. I left assured that I, a Black girl, had done my best.
Nice guys finish last, right? That’s the lie we’ve all been told for so long. The thing is, I’m not quite sure where it came from. But whoever made it up, surely did find a way to pretty much entrench it into the minds of most men (at least many men that I know and have come across).
Afterwards, I took a nice long nap, to get ready for my 'bash'. The Hubs and the kids took me to the restaurant. Sadly, I don't have any photos from this event because even though I brought my camera, I was too busy being "in the moment" to take any. Friends did take some for me, though, I just haven't gotten copies from them yet. No worries on that scrappin' front! My bestest buds were there, plus a couple of their husbands... and a surprise friend who is my LONGEST running friend since I moved here to Ohio. We don't get to spend a lot of time together because our lives move in such wildly separate directions, so it was awesome that she was able to make it. From my friends I got some lovely gifts, including a wonderful art print (she has a different art print in her office that I have coveted) all the way from New Mexico...

over and over thinking, no way can it be that easy but it was. The only problem I had was trying to protect my floors from all the spray adhesive. I need to square it up in the morning, attach the binding then make a label and call it done. The downstairs is covered in minky fuzz, lots of dusting, vacuuming and mopping will be going on after I enjoy my free day. I feel like a kid who just found out they are having a snow day off from school!!
You are right. It is ironic how all those times that we were there, going to same malls, eating at same restaurants, maybe doing some same things, We never met. Ironic how we had to know each other here. And God gave you to me right when everything was almost settled. May sound weird but yeah, everything was in good timing. Certainly not perfect, we know that, but the God was indeed strategic with His timing.
almost as surely

When I do get a new one it'll be larger so I can take the second (beer) box outta the office. Don't need it like I did 20 years ago when we moved here and used to keep plenty of beer on hand. :-)
CROYDEN: Homeowner shot dead by black attackers despite desperate attempt by housekeeper.
The Security Chief returns his prisoner and begins to interrogate the Doctor but the War Chief interrupts and reveals that the Doctor is from his same race and that he indeed knows him! We then get a glorious scene where the Doctor talks about stealing a TARDIS and his reasons to leave his home planet. The War Chief also reveals that the point of the War Games are as a testing ground to find the perfect army for a universal conquest by the War Lords, claiming, "man is the most vicious species of all!" I like this in theory but I'm not sure how true it is in the Doctor Who universe. The War Chief also explains that he wants to create a United Galactic Empire. The War Lord agrees to spare the Doctor, but make's the War Chief responsible for him. The War Chief also reveals to the Doctor his intentions to take over as Supreme Galactic Leader; something that he will regret saying later.
Just then I hit another bump in the road, and the voice shouted out, "Hey!" in an accusatory manner. I recognized Shrek's tinny voice that time and grinned to myself. At the next bump the plastic McDonald's toy protested again, "Hey!" My amusement grew, but it wasn't until I crossed the railroad tracks and Shrek lost his temper shouting, "Alright! Cut it out!" that I couldn't keep my giggles to myself.

Recently in SXSW conclave, American Express (Amex) has been appreciated for encouraging use of social media. They not only to engage their customers, but also for encouraging business to offer their products and services to amex card members enabled with geo targeting ads. And making a couponless solution.
These targets are “may be morbid” for you but they hold significance in my life and in the life of many other people. Many people must have already achieved these necessary targets but I am finding myself able and efficient to achieve them now.
Ok anyway enough of blah blahing.

That's right! They had the story about Jesus asking Peter to step out of the boat in the middle of the lake with him, didn't they?
When I was 14, my mother, trying to find some group activity where I could meet others my age (my very social, extroverted, and outgoing sister made friends wherever she went, and so never really caused worry in that area for my parents!), my mother came across the Air Cadets. A Department of Defence funded youth program, based on military structure. A big draw was that it was entirely free! Hey, why not, I thought. So my sister and I both joined. When I tell people now, in all my anarchist hippieness, that I was in cadets for three years, they look at me in shock! To be honest, I find it rather surprising myself, at this point! :-P But I learned a lot in those three years, and not any of it stuff you'll find in brochures advertising the program. There was so much bullying, so much dishonesty and bullshitting, so much sucking up to officers in charge, and treating lower ranked cadets like dirt. It was stressful most of the time, fun occasionally. I learned just how things SHOULDN'T be! Just how people shouldn't interact. It helped shape and solidify my opinions, so that when I finally decided I'd had enough when I was 17 and left, I was searching. Searching for the things I thought were right, the ways I thought people should live and be. It was shortly after I left that I embraced unschooling, and started seriously looking into anarchy. It still amazes me I lasted that long in cadets, and though it seems strange and rather silly to say, that time, though I don't regret it, did hurt me in some ways. I learned what it was like to be treated as lesser, to be made to feel shame for making mistakes, to function within a rigid structure of rules, to be constantly judged.

As the likes of the aggressive and seemingly vindictive Burn The Sun, the compulsive and crushing Countless Wounds, and the title track leave the senses bloody and gasping for breath from the onslaught the album shows no mercy despite offering up sparkling invention and tempering asides. The band is at its very best though when they let the imaginative craft and ideas have a fuller rein. The brooding opening to Blood Red Desert Plain suggests more of the same of that which came just before it but although still a battering upon the ear it brings a glorious crimson skyline with grand soaring keys to add a full and epic disposition to the track and ear.
Also, more importantly, imagine being called a criminal for life just because they indulged in an act in the heat of the moment or out of curiosity.
As a parent, it’s heartbreaking to watch my daughter waste away before my eyes, to see her intense fear of food – the one thing that once provided, energy, health, strength and nourishment to her body & brain is now a subject of fear. I never envisaged this life. In all the years she and her brothers suffered chronic asthma as children, and were hospitalised countless times fighting to breathe. I never imagined that I would find myself again, fighting alongside her, willing her to choose life, encouraging her to beat an insidious disease that threatens her life.
Next, Chef Stefano whipped up a mouthwatering seafood risotto.. oh my lord, the smell of the risotto cooking was just lovely. Chef Stefano tells us that the most important thing to remember when making a risotto are the 3 steps: 1.Toast the rice with butter, 2.Keep stirring and adding stock in small amounts and 3. Add butter/olive oil in the end (the mantecatura) Looks like my recipe for mushroom risotto has all the right requirements for a good risotto. ;)
Did you know that Friday, February 3 was Wear Red Day to fight heart disease in women?
Nightmares: they are scary and disturbing, often about neglect or lack of preparation, I miss my alarm, show up without shoes. My wife might dream that she forgets to feed the peanut or leaves him somewhere… I actually have often had similar baby-neglect dreams over the years, but have pleasantly discovered that most of the time, they get fed and have never been seriously misplaced.
So yes, I'm done here... I have been for over a week. I went through HS once and I'm not trying to do it all over again. I left for the simple reason people are b!tches! I have enough real dramaz in my life. So GBCN! I do still love a few of you... you know who you are, lol. And I have the guts to say blondie is a two faced b!tch. NNO, you are sweet but you need get a pair of balls, and know who your true friends are, your secret would have been save with me. And Kel, you're two faced too. And BW- you have no right to call anyone else out... I mean you're like the debbie downer of 12-24 and you're always looking to tear someone else down so you feel better about yourself. And you're like the farthest from normal. LOL...

And so, last October, I began my research on POD publishing. First, I visited every site I could possibly find on POD, from sheer Vanity publishers like Dorrance and Vantage, to a multitude of subsidy publishers and even traditional publishers who had set up a sister subsidy wing, as an example of this: Discovered/Undiscovered Authors. I critiqued and recorded all the information I could find. Let me also add, I read a number of books on self-publishing, including those by Mark Levine and Dan Poynter among others. I also found various writing forums which were immensely informative. My approach with the forums, if possible, was to observe as a guest for a period of time, and then register at a later date. Several on yahoo, I could not be bothered with. They are either too little frequented or full of spammers. One of the better forums is called Christianwriters. It is on my favoured links. I do regularly visit this forum but have never posted to it. That’s not because it is not an excellent forum, but if I’m honest, I simply do not think it digs deeply enough into the publishing business, rather it discusses the same issues, and yet, even then, barely scratches the surface. The two forums I think best suited to an author considering POD publishing are Absolutewrite and Books&Tales.

Reading and book signing with David Lunt. It was David who gave me the idea of developing the Literature side of the festival. He has recently been published and will be giving a reading followed by talking about getting published and recounting his recent experiences.
This is a lesson that has been reinforced to me hard recently, as I have been moved to a part of town I am very unfamiliar with. Sometimes the maps (whether hand drawn, or GIS) is not enough. This (hypothetically of course) could lead to you running a fire in your second due and not knowing 100% were you are going and ending up 2nd due. Sure you still get to do some good fireground work but you should have been on the initial attack line and….well Im rambling and this in no way really happened (lol).

It’s Friday, so it seems unfair to have to scratch your heads at a conundrum that emerged from the High Court yesterday. NAMA Top 10 developer Treasury Holdings is in the wars with NAMA. In January, NAMA had receivers appointed to a slew of Treasury properties and companies; Treasury got upset and applied to the High Court in Dublin for a judicial review of NAMA’s dealings with its loans; the courts last month granted Treasury its wish for a judicial review which is set to take place in the coming months. Treasury is, according to NAMA and it doesn’t seem to be disputed by any party, “massively insolvent” – it has loans of €2.7bn including €1.7bn from NAMA and its assets are worth half that, so that NAMA says the company was insolvent to the tune of €859m. So NAMA, naturally enough given it is facing into an expensive court case where it will defend its dealings with Treasury’s loans, sought security for its costs (should it win of course). This preliminary point was set to come before the High Court yesterday, but just beforehand, NAMA came to an agreement with Treasury which is reported by the Irish Times today and is as follows:
* Inundating cultivated lands with toxic herbicides, in particular the dangerous Monsanto product Roundup, to which the GMO seeds have been made biotechnically resistant. Any other growth should succumb to Roundup, were it not for the fact that weeds to a very large extent become Roundup resistant.

For those of you who are tech heads, the 4061 are omnidirectional miniature condenser mics. When I say miniature I mean miniature, like the size of a pencil eraser. The mics have a frequency response of 20Hz to 20kHz with a 3 db soft boost from 8-20 kHz and wide dynamic range of 97dB. But what makes these mics ideal for live situations is the fact that the max SPL before peaking or clipping is 144 dB and the total harmonic distortion is less than 1% up to 123 dB SPL. In layman’s terms that means great sound reproduction in close micing situations with no clipping or distorting. Amazing!!!

Standing 6ft 1in, Rivaldo was an imposing figure for such a technician – unusual for someone of such slight build. But slight he was and his rubbery gait made him seem even more of an unlikely hero. That said, his bow-like anatomy echoed another of Brazil’s most famous sons – the distinctively bent-legged Garrincha.
Mental illness is also a product. The closer the blood relative, the higher the risk of schizophrenic illness. The increased risk of insanity may explain why more than 40% of the patients in Denmark 's biggest ward for clinically insane criminals have an immigrant background.

For the dish, just ladle the mushrooms and vegetables on a dish and top with Vegan feta cheese. If you can’t find Vegan feta cheese, Vegan mozzarella would be delicious as well. If you’re really going for the lowest calories, serve the dish without the gravy. It will still be juicy and the taste of the mushrooms will be intensified. Garnish with parsley and serve.
I have been at the airport about three hours now and am a little board, so I figured I would open up trusty old laptop and write a post to pass the time.
We can not tune others, all we can do is lead others to an encounter where God can tune, sure they can listen to what we play and copy it, but it will be a copy it will come back out of tune it will be a struggle as they listen to what we have played but what we have is based on others, so the original tuning will be far away from what He intended it to sound like, but if we create an environment in which God can come and continually tune and perfect, we will be in sync as we play, not constantly struggling to support the person but as we play and they hear God shapes us all as individuals and as a body. Complimenting the sound others make and creating depth and a wonderful layered, unique song.
I have to say thanks to my mum for this, she is the most wonderful example of woman I could possibly think of. She is incredibly strong and passionate in everything she does and she went through every kind of situation all the times only by herself. And now she is finally living her own life, the life she chose to live, counting only on her great ability to solve things and on her intelligence. She is the most independent person I have ever known, she could do anything, and she taught me about the importance of counting on yourself and learning how to solve problems and situations alone.

Best option for your Honor mounts is to wait for Alterac Valley weekend and farm the lot. You get far more HP for AV than any other weekend. Also do the quests from the AV entrance area to get further Stormpike reputation. Its not too bad and you can farm gear and mounts while you do it. I might skip this. I depends if an AV weekend comes up before I get 100 mounts and what else I am doing that weekend.

Finally, I am thankful for you, our friends. The ranks of troops in Levi’s battles are filled with people from our past, present, and future. Some we’ve known for years, others we may never meet. But we count all who have offered our son up in prayer as dear friends, and I hope that here in this life or someday in heaven to be able to greet each of you face to face and thank you. You have provided us with food, money, fuel cards, help at home, cards, encouraging notes, and so much more. Thank you for continuing to fight alongside us in Levi’s battle.

I am still a bit bummed that we lost power last night for a few minutes do so some stupidity at National Grid. I know it was only a minute or two that it was out but we were watching the Ten Commandments when it happened. It was when the Angel of Death was creeping around and killing all the first born. That is my favorite part, well expect for the parting of the Red Sea, and the Burning Bush, of and when he throws the tablets at the Golden Cow. Well, at least we got to see the end. The end always brings two thoughts to my head. The first is why can't poor Moses go to the promised land? That is just so wrong. And second. When they talk about the Ark of the Covenant I keep thinking about what happens if you open that suckers. Hello Indiana Jones!!!
We found today that the bearing assembly on the spinning feed is "almost shot" (it's got a lot of play in it), and although we can physically move each axis through its range of motion very smoothly (the mechanical stuff seems OK), when we turn on the servos and use the manually position hand wheels, the elevation axis doesn't respond smoothly. It kind of 'bumps and jumps' in response to commands from the Antenna Control Unit.
Military operations against non-state armed groups in Khyber Agency have prompted the mass displacement since January 2012. “The situation is particularly critical as the government states it could last up to six months while the humanitarian community expects that families will not be able to return until early 2013. There are also fears that 20,000 more families will be displaced as the conflict spreads to other parts of Khyber Agency.” PHF reported.

It's called the ''Cookie cake'' because it has a tiny Leibniz chocolate cookie on it. And as you can see, it has 7 layers. The chocolate layer on the bottom is the best. There's some yellow cake, some chocolate cake, the crumb, and the rest is frosting. Chocolate, vanilla, I don't even know what it's made of. It's just so good when you taste the whole cake with all the seven layers... Nom.
There isn’t a tag on the other gray fiber. I don’t know what it is. I asked my spinning teacher and she wasn’t sure either. It is more of a brownish-gray color. It has some white hairs sticking out from it. It dyed a darker blue color, which looks like new denim jeans. Another pleasing color.
Please tell me I'm not the only one who sees a resemblance?
JJ: More powerful. That’s what I was trying to say. Your sense of his urgency, to get as many of the facts as he can and to make the most sense of them that he can…it creates a suspense, because immediately, the dog’s tail goes up… Elif Batuman is somebody else that I would put on that list.

So the question becomes, how much do they actually burn the economy back, and how much obligation do we have to bail them out? Personally, I don't think we have much obligation to these people or the institutions that lent them the money. The only reason to jump in with taxpayer money is if the hole left by this segment of the population will destroy the economy.
"No headscarves, no vote," shouted sixty-odd women who gathered outside the parliament building in Ankara on April 8. "As it stands, our democracy is half-baked", said the group's spokeswoman, Nesrin Semiz. "Two-thirds of Turkish women cover their heads. Not one of them has a seat in parliament."

The result is that every time I pick up the book, and this character appears, I can picture that card in his wallet, and I can feel the tension for him to find and remove it. It has helped the story immensely.
He found his mouth opening to argue this and then shut it. What was the point? But now, with her mind engaged, she was prepared to defend her claim. She came closer then and lightly laid her lilac-gloved hand on his arm.
It was at this point that I put the cooled pecans, on the cookie sheet, into a 350 degree oven for 10-12 minutes – check them at 10 minutes so that you don’t overcook them, like I did.

That’s what happened to me last year. Since then, however, I’ve gotten rid of 2 of those burnt orange shoes and purchased two pairs of nudes and I’ve started checking out my shoes, not just for colors, but styles. Most people have a particular style they prefer (I tend to like closed toe stilettos, doesn’t matter if it’s a round, square, or pointed toe – it’s more about the heel for me… but for other people, it’s more about the toe or they like a bigger or chunkier heel than I do.), but even with your preferences, it’s best to have a few items that go away from the norm. Just recently, I bought two pairs of wedges because I noticed that out of all the shoes I had, I only had 2 wedges in my closet and one of them needed to go to the shoe doctor on U Street. Que horible!

Diablo III is insanely over-simplified. You cannot put any stats on your character, it’s automatic. You can’t identify items anymore, it’s automatic. You can’t pick from different skill trees as you see fit, there are four skills in different categories predetermined and you can only pick one from each category, such as one out of the four defense skills. The graphics in terms of environment and atmosphere are brilliant. I truly love them and the mood the game sets is astounding. However, character design in terms of beauty and processing power look old and dull. You tell me with a straight face that the male Wizard doesn’t resemble Orlando Bloom. Go ahead. I dare ya.
Anyway, inaccurate meteorological similes notwithstanding, I used to think the hardest part of the job must be pretending to get all excited over the next episode of some hastily cobbled together art programme where a bloke tries to craft a crown out of twigs without making a four-year-old look like Jesus, when in reality you've just split up with your other half, have a tequila hangover and feel grumpier than a hippo with hemorrhoids.
Israelis and everyone else have been debating a “two state solution” to grant the murderous Palestinians some legitimacy. For my part, I think American Jews should stay out of this discussion. Intrinsically, almost genetically liberal, they experienced the Holocaust protected by the Atlantic Ocean so, while one assumes they support Israel’s existence, it is entirely up to the Israeli’s to make such decisions. Parenthetically, even the Israelis have been divided over the issue, but not over their survival.

This caught my interest on the news earlier. Black Girls Run is a running group started in 2009 by 2 African American women who started running as a way to tackle the growing obesity epidemic in the African American community. On their blog site they discuss making physical fitness a priority. Also on their site, I found a shocking statistic. According to the Centers for Disease Control, 80% of African American women are overweight. This isnt only a problem in the African American community. This is an issue that is effecting the entire country. I encourage you to check out the Black Girls Run, BGR , website. There are some motivating stories and tips, African American or not, I think you will enjoy it. they even have a soundtrack preview. You know I love the tunes! I may have to steal some of thier recommendations.

The audience is encouraged to participate in the Hard Harry experience, and do so usually by sending letters to his P.O. Box. His favourite correspondence is with a listener he dubs the "Eat Me Beat Me Lady," who is, in reality, a Hubert Humphrey High student named Nora DeNiro (Samantha Mathis). Sending him erotic poetry on a semi-regular basis, which is written on the same red paper and written in the same black handwriting, Nora and Harry seem to have a weird chemistry with one another, despite the fact that they've never met.
But he feels glad that it’s his birthday for the first time in his life.

I am glad to note that some humans share my peculiar fascination. The organisers of the Long Nose World Championship, to be held next month in Germany, are still looking for promising candidates to compete in their “snoot out”. Unfortunately, women from really long-nosed nations, like Armenia and Moldova, are reluctant to participate for fear of damaging their marital prospects. This is a great shame. I’m sure there are many single men who would love to have their nerve-endings nuzzled by a long-nosed wife. "If you've got it, poke it!" would be an apt slogan for such ladies.

"Where there is life there is hope." I know people are going to get tired of hearing this from me. I have said it, written it to people and I have even written articles about it. Where there is life there is hope isn't about addiction, our addicts, and our children, it is about life and hope.

I know this sounds like I’m angling for a free drink (which I would never be so rude as to knock back were it offered) but you just know you’re in The Taphouse. Let me explain. We made our way through the crush to the upstairs bar, which was even busier, and settled against a wall with a starting pot of Matilda Bay Alpha Pale Ale. The bar was packed with punters representing a fairly widespread demographic including plenty of Sydney Swans supporters fresh from their win over Brisbane at the SCG.

As one can easily see, all the conclusions are based on an economic or business analysis, even though the right to data portability is introduced in data protection legislation, which envisages basically “the person”.

The Vimana and the Gopurams are the distinctive characteristics of the Southern style. The present temple was built about two centuries ago by Garhwal Kings.

I am still very new at this having only published my first novel on June 3rd this year. But I think that at 70% royalty on my ebooks I will make more money than I could if traditionally published – if I could have ever managed to get a contract for Changers’ Summer anyway. In which case any money is more than I would have received.

I have two teenagers, and rapper Wiz Khalifa’s “Black and Yellow,” a tribute to his hometown of Pittsburgh, got plenty of play in our house this year. So when I watched the new parody video hit “Black and Jewish,” I got the joke on several levels. I also knew it was going to make a lot of people uncomfortable. After mulling it over, I wanted to weigh in with my perspective as an adult interfaith child.

The thing is that artists are extremely courageous in facing their own ‘self’. At that very moment of giving birth to an art piece they lack both fear of failure and fear of enormous abilities of human mind to connect with the unknown. So basically in some people the urge to make art overcomes any kind of fear by putting a trust upon oneself. Unfortunately, this feeling most of the people cannot control so they call it Inspiration.
In conversation, give us a chance to speak and express our feelings on the subject matter. One of the most noted turn-offs is when females don’t give me room to speak or are too self-absorbed to notice that I’m bored with the conversation.

Correlation of the Week, as Harry Hill would say, was yesterday’s head-on debate between the Indie and the Torygraph, “Does this House believe that immigrants take jobs residents could’ve had?” To which the answer is self-evidently yes, if jobs are scarce and the residents really want them; and no, if business is booming and we’re short of labour. Each had their own pet research study to support a case that didn’t need any research at all to support it, but such is the awe with which statistics are beheld these days, it didn’t seem to occur to either side that they were asking the wrong question.
This problem is so great from the evolutionist point of view that the closer we look at the details, the worse the quandary the theory finds itself in. One important “detail” which needs to be looked at is the claim about “the cell which came to be sensitive to light.” Darwinists gloss this over by saying, “Sight may have started by a single cell becoming sensitive to light.” But what kind of design is such a structure supposed to have had?

Hope you are enjoying your holidays! I am escaping what feels like siberia, writing from the airport... on my way to thailand!! I went out last night for our traditional after-xmas party and came home in the morning just to change clothes... at least I’ll be able to sleep on the plane. I tried to take some wintery pictures in the snow, but the camera stopped working. Can't blame it.. it was -28 degrees.

The City of Wilson’s $28 million Greenlight service is the prototype of municipal broadband in this state, launched just two years ago and now claiming about 4,800 customers. The City of Salisbury will be next with its $30 million Fibrant service, scheduled to be offered later this year. Meanwhile, Fayetteville is set to study its own version of municipal broadband this summer and could decide this year whether to proceed.
I’m also excited to change my diet up as well. Shauna and I have decided to make “our” household a light carb/carb-free environment. Given that I have a love-hate relationship with bread, the change is a necessary one. I know for a fact that I can do it, I actually relish in the thought of the freedom of not being weighed down by all the wheat in my system. I successfully adopted a low fat, low calorie, low sodium, high healthy protein diet in September when I needed to drop 10 pounds in 2 weeks to fit into a bridesmaid dress for my friend’s wedding. It was like a 2 week cleanse that I kept up for a couple months afterwards. I discovered a salad recipe that I love and have yet to get sick of.

Today, what do we have in America to carry us into the next boom? Nothing. The Internet isn’t creating jobs. Manufacturing, it’s gone to Mexico, India and China. I doubt George Washington ever envisioned a future where Americans would be suffering so much. It’s embarrassing, but true: Over 44 million people in this country are using some form of food stamps!

Can you lose your mind to a 1980s fad? A man twisted up over his responsibilities becomes increasingly averse to reality, and works through this by obsessively trying to solve the classic toy, while he also wonders just what happened to his Smurf puppet? Unusual, in a good way.

Tactics against a Ghost: If you have armor lock, pretend you don’t until the last minute (lag may make this a foolish option). Overcharged pistols really take it out of ghosts- after the first shot though give them another once the gun has cooled down. Hijacking a ghost is quite easy but grenades rarely tip them over. Small arms fire is fairly effective against them.

Password-protect your phone – and consider encryption options. To ensure the password is effective, set the “password required” time to zero, and restart phone before you leave your house. Be aware that merely password-protecting or locking your phone is not an effective barrier to expert forensic analysis. Some phones also have encryption options. Whispercore is a full-disk encryption application for Android, and Blackberry also has encryption tools that might potentially be useful. Note that EFF has not tested these tools and does not endorse them, but they are worth checking into.

There is way too much cardinal and gold nutritious stuff coursing through my veins, carrying salt and oxygen and electrolytes and whatever it is fans crave, to ever turn my back on the program now. But how much of of that real loyalty is the result of the past nine years? How much of it is tied up with the highs from 2003 to 2005? How much of it is based on the crest of those years and its attendant belief that all this was deserved for the years of mediocrity suffered through, that any fan worth his salt weathers the storm, sticks by his team and collects the schedule poster no matter what?
It is cold...really cold. I think that even folks who live in regular houses are cold with all of this arctic weather going on. Last night, we returned from visiting a local restaurant and as we stood outside the door of the RV my husband's key wasn't working. Frantically and freezing I am digging through what my son referred to earlier as the bowels of my purse searching for my set of keys, the two layers of clothing don't seem to be helping at all. IT was 17 degrees!! Finally, I find them and try the door, it opens but the inside screen door seems to be frozen shut. All is well, we all file into the RV and huddle around the heater...my daughter is giggling uncontrollably as we are all hugging each other warming our hands and our hearts. Living this life for the last 16 months has brought about so many family moments. Moments that take my breath away in awe for the love we share as a unit. The five of us, living in incredibly close quarters. Our only escape from our togetherness is the great outdoors. There are no bedroom doors to slam shut, there is no place to hide from conflict...it's all here, right in front of us. And with this arctic blast of weather we are all here huddled together figuring out how to make it all work.
In 1498, Michelangelo got his first important commission: the “Pieta“(1498–1499), which is a masterpiece of Renaissance sculpture and one of the most representative masterpiece of the Italian culture. “La Pietà” di Michelangelo (= “The pity” of Michelangelo) is a sculpture in Carrara marble, (high 174cm, wide 195cm, deep 69cm), housed in St. Peter’s Basilica in Vatican City, Rome. This famous work of art depicts the body of Jesus on the lap of his mother Mary, after the Crucifixion. This is the first, dramatic masterpiece of the then Michelangelo in his early twenties, considered one of the greatest masterpieces of Western art has ever produced. It is also the only work signed by him, on the sling that holds the mantle of the Virgin.
She's a pecker. Oh my goddess, she is one BAMP (Bad Ass Mother Pecker). She likes my silver hairs, my wiggly eyeballs, food in my teeth (any food I've got, really) and my teeny-tiny diamond earring (in my ear) from Mitch. I like a friendly and non-mauling chicken-friend. I've compromised by redirecting her fascination with all-things-reflective-or-tasty-about-me with my telephone screen. (It's not tactile responsive) I always add a reward to her phone pecks: neck scratches, cooing, petting.

He condemns Christian love because he thinks it is an outcome of fear… It does not occur to Nietzsche as possible that a man should genuinely feel universal love, obviously because he himself feels almost universal hatred and fear, which he would fain disguise as lordly indifference. His “noble” man–who is himself in day-dreams–is a being wholly devoid of sympathy, ruthless, cunning, concerned only with his own power. King Lear, on the verge of madness, says: “I will do such things–what they are yet I know not–but they shall be the terror of the earth.” This is Nietzsche’s philosophy in a nutshell.

This year, the game is at Candlestick in San Francisco. If both teams happen to take Wild Card spots, this head-to-head match-up will be important come playoff time.

However, the mind of your average mad scientist works differently than most people. The desire to insert things into places that weren't meant to have things inserted into them seems to consume the entirety of their being. After dismounting his female zombie (he pleasured himself utilizing her abdominal wound as a makeshift vagina), Baron Frankenstein says to Otto, "to know death, you have to fuck life in the gallbladder." Briefly removing the modesty patch that covers her actual vagina, as if to say, I have no interest in this puckered mound of opulent flesh, Otto, imitating his master, begins caressing the stitches that snake seductively along the female zombie's succulent stomach with his tongue. Once his misguided attempt at foreplay is over, he's ready to pierce her wound. Of course, all doesn't go as planned (he's not as experienced as the Baron when it comes to performing gash-based cunnilingus), and the dumbfounded lab assistant has nothing but a floor covered with vital organs to show for his oral trouble.

We arrived on Friday, and spent a great week ,visited our neighbors and relatives, went shopping 5 times, visited my favorite place " Al Roubai'e street" , went to the restaurants in Baghdad, celebrated valentine (grandpa took us to a nice restaurant) ,oh Baghdad looked wonderful that day, it was full of white and red , people dressing red, carrying roses and balloons, restaurants were filled with lovers and the decoration was special that day, I ordered a steak and it came with a heart shape candle, such a lovely idea.. for one day I forgot all about situation and routine .. people celebrate that day with their loved ones and families, and I heard a guy talking in one channel he said " this year, people exaggerated in celebrating valentine they're walking carrying red bears, roses , balloons and cars are filled with roses , load music everywhere, and that's all happening to embitter those who threatened us not to celebrate valentine, it is an overreaction" .. well,

It’s a phrase that I had to mentally repeat daily during my last semester of college. I was enrolled in a feature writing class that I loved, really I did, except for the time between submitting my article to the professor and receiving her feedback. It didn’t matter what sort of comment she wrote in the margin; it could have been a punctuation change. Whatever it was made me see red. Stubbornly, instead of learning from what she, the experienced professional, was flagging in my work, I dug in my heels and snottily thrust my nose in the air. She just didn’t know what she was talking about, I thought. My work was perfect.

I remember this transition clearly from my own adolescence. After a carefree childhood, I suddenly felt locked inside myself, alone with thoughts and feelings which no one else would ever be able to experience. Along with that, I felt an acute self-consciousness. I was aware of every movement I made and every word I spoke, so that I couldn’t do anything naturally anymore. I felt exposed when I walked down the street, aware that people could have been looking at me from their windows.
Also even long after you have given up, be prepared for the occasion twinge of sadness when it strikes you that you will never light up after a good meal or a cup of coffee again. For some, that sadness will never leave you. My darling mother once said that a smoker never becomes a non-smoker, they merely become smokers who are not smoking at the moment. Like me, she was a committed smoker who would invariably light a cigarette before making a telephone call, but, unlike me, she was born into an age where everyone smoked, and they all thought it was good for them.

Yes, I know too the world I describe is only one found in a fantasy world...or maybe that is what heaven is like?
Having been born during the Great Depression of the 1930s, I have now lived long enough to be in a new Depression. The irony is that both had their roots in government policies and, in both cases, were prolonged by government hostility to corporations, banks, and other generators of income and growth.

The Plot: A historical note at the front explains that Deogratias is set in late 1994, early 1995, in Rwanda, and gives background about the Hutu majority and Tutsi minority of Rwanda. This is a work of fiction; it is the story of Deogratias, a teenage boy who is a Hutu; and two teenage sisters who are Tutsi, Apollinaria and Benina. It begins after the Rwandan Genocide (800,00 to 1,000,000 dead); and has characters from all sides, the Hutus, the Tutsis, the observers, those who acted and those who did not.
The promises weren't implied, yet there's no documentation other than the contract made in blood that somehow translates into this child who is from me, part of me and yet separate and no more clearly so than when he argues with me over eating his broccoli.

There was also the guy who wasn't even attending who started complaining on Facebook about the safe space policy. The reason he wasn't attending? His band were kicked off the line-up last year for having a song that promotes rape (link to article about it, not the band/song). He then also pulled the 'it's much worse to say that we have a song that promotes rape than for us to actually promote rape, what about our safe space?'. OH POOR BABY.
It doesn’t seem to matter what the content of the story is that we tell our customers. What does matter is that whatever we say should make them feel special. And that is the end of the story.

A nice starting place would be getting rid of the stupid laws that say an 18.1" shotgun barrel is fine, but a 17.9" barrel is evil incarnate. Laws that say a sound suppressor, which costs $5 to make is a "deadly weapon" and needs a $200 tax. Commonsense things. Common sense out of Washington? Expect the opposite.

~A pair of matching chairs
When a man loves a woman, he pays her parents dowry. The more he loves her, the more cows he takes to her parents’ home. The fewer and thinner the cows, the less dosage of love the man has for his wife. But at times a woman may love a poor man. To demonstrate her love for him, love may force her to elope with her darling in the heart of the night or on her way to the river. That is true love.
Book Two, A Tangle of Magicks, will come out in August 2011. It’s set in Regency-era Bath, where Kat and her family get tangled up in a scandalous adventure with rakes, Napoleonic spies, and dangerous wild magic.
Teddy tells Cristina that she has a special operation for her, which turns out to be an angioplasty. Cristina doesn’t like it one bit because it is a first year’s operation and since she’s a fifth she thinks that she has nothing she can learn from it. Meredith asks Teddy for an explanation and Teddy of course doesn’t have to give her the explanation because it’s not her business. But Meredith and Cristina are practically joined at the hip – well they would be if Meredith wasn’t wearing those ridiculous pink scrubs. She tells her that it is all about respect … most heart diseases start in the arteries. And you have to go back to the beginning to get to the end.

Add soya sauce and vegetarian oyster sauce. Add a little water and let the dish simmer for a while or until the turnips turn soft. Add salt to taste. You can wrap the fried turnips with leafy vegetable and eat it with white rice. Alternatively, you can also use the fried turnips to make spring rolls!

Playing tour guide to someone new to Ghana was amazing: it was amazing to see Ghana through new eyes again, and it was the first time I realized that I’m no longer new in Ghana. Ya! I can get around in the hectic city of Accra, figure out what tro-tro station I need to be at to get to another region, I know what delicious food to eat on the street and how much it should cost, I know how to bargain with taxi drivers like nobody’s business, I can small-talk with strangers in my Ghanaian accent endlessly, I can stand waiting for transport tirelessly and I can swap money for treats out the bus window with lightning speed. I hadn’t realized these small parts of everyday life are now second nature to me in my new home of Ghana.

In this version of Japan, the National Welfare Act decrees that all first graders are injected with a vaccine. One in a thousand are injected with a capsule that will go off at a certain time, between their 18th and 24th birthdays, instantly killing them. Nobody knows who has the capsules until the very last day they are alive, and messengers are sent out with a 24 hour death notice, or ikigami. The reason for this is to encourage people to live meaningful, productive, and full lives. To be one of the capsule carriers is considered an honor, as that person is helping to carry on the mission.

My craft room was in desperate need of a work surface. I wanted a desk with a large working area but that wouldn't be too chunky. I looked for something used but only found small writing desks that looked nice but wouldn't be large enough for my needs or large boxy office desks that weren't really my style. There are tons of beautiful desks available at places like Pottery Barn, West Elm, and Crate and Barrel, but they usually start at $300 or so and go way up from there. So, I turned to my favorite source for inexpensive new furniture: Ikea.
The first few years after the 1994 election, the ANC and NP ruled together in a coalition. So the ANC has actually only been in power for ten years. Ten years it took them to redudce a prosperous first world country to the rubbish it is now. Compared to the almost 30 years it took other African countries to go through the same, it looks as if the ANC is going for a record.
The activists’ move comes against the backdrop of Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa’s assertion that the plant would go critical in the next 10 days and power generation would begin then.

So I popped to the till, and passed them my card and the above little tub. The woman behind the counter was lovely, and mentioned that as I had only spent £4 that they had a nail file for a £1 to take it up to the £5. Bonus! I would have been quite happy going with losing that extra £1, so it was great that the sales lady mentioned it.
According to Google, more than fifty percent of all books are now sold over the Internet. Amazon.com sales accounted for 5.96 billion dollars of those sales last year; these numbers are expected to rise in the upcoming years. Although this may be bad news for the traditional brick and mortar book stores, it’s good news for online sellers. Knowing how to have your book found through search inquiries on sites such as Google and Yahoo has become crucial to selling books. Online visibility begins with your book’s title.
I would love some input from my readers on this.

In the 73-65 loss to Bishop Gorman at the Hoop Hall Classic it appeared as though foul shooting and individual defense are two areas in which they will have to improve on in order to be compared with the likes of the last undefeated team at DeMatha. The zone defense that DeMatha started out in proved to be too slow during the rotations to Shabazz Muhammad, and he had 19 points in the first half of play alone. By the time DeMatha switched to man-to-man midway through the second quarter the damage was done, and Bishop Gorman took an eight point lead into the locker room.

When I return to Provence after an extended absence I am always astounded by the raw beauty of the region and in particular the Alpilles where our farm is located. Without fail I ask if they realise how fortunate and blessed they are to have lived their lives in this idyllic countryside...The answer is always the same....bien sur..... as if to say... is there any where else? It is as if I am the foolish one, the one who is missing out. To be surrounded by such magnificence all of your days is an exceptional state, to be aware and appreciative of your good fortune at the same time is rare. When I read this quotation from William Henry Channing, I couldn't help but think of this Provencal couple....

I can't tell you how many times one of my high schoolers has asked for help on physics or calculus or some other difficult assignment and just about as soon as she explains the problem to me, she'll say, "Nevermind. I figured it out." The act of explaining the question teaches the mind to think through the solution. Homeschooling allows plenty of time for asking the questions and talking about the solutions.
Some of this stuff has *got* to be delegated. The most obvious solution is to delegate the chart audits, probably to the night staff (which will, I'm sure, make me their most favorite person ever). The other stuff, I'm not so sure about. We've got to get more people trained in the more obscure test protocols; the obvious solution is to train the charge nurses for the other CCUs. I'm not sure how well that'd go over, though, as they're just as overwhelmed as I am.
Also, the view is breathtaking!!! The adventure park itself is laden with lush green gardens, a stone chapel, camping facilities & a hotel. If you’re not into the adrenaline rush, the location is also a perfect venue for celebrations such as birthdays, conferences and weddings. Or if you just want to have a quiet and relaxing time away from the hustle & bussle of the city, this is still a great place to go.

So, if you accept the fact that an infant has needs, isn't it rational to also think that their need for comfort outweighs their need for independence? Isn't it rational to think that their need for the intimacy and security of closeness outweighs their need for alone time? And isn't it rational to think that their need for you outweighs their need for nearly anything else? You alone can choose whether or not to meet your baby's needs and demonstrate to them the power behind meeting needs in general.
Only because I do not like to summarize.
With Soul II Soul's Nellee Hooper at the helm, Debut offered a seductive hybrid of contemporary groove science and fusion-esque jazzual flava, laced with exotica (Talvin Singh's tabla) and just enough traces of Björk's quirky-scary intensity to stave off home-listening diva blandness. It was a monstrous success, but many believers felt this new Björk was a tad too innocuously chic – a Sade for the Nineties. Björk agrees: "I felt guilty about a lot of things I did on Debut. I was so insecure and shy with that album, but on Post I was braver."

Dan wants to surf and the West side of the island is world famous for the surfing (although the waves may be a bit much for us!). He might take lessons or just rent a surfboard and play around. I get nervous around big waves but I might be adventurous and try it! I know I will be soaking up the sun and snorkeling whenever I can! We love taking trips together and it is great to rejuvenate and spend time together. We always have a blast together and it’s great for our relationship! Taking trips together is a priority for us and hopefully we can continue to have adventures in the future!
1. Lots of biblical scholars generally agree that various things recorded in the Bible actually occurred in real life — a) Jesus really lived; b) Jesus really died by crucifixion; c) Jesus’s disciples, as well as Paul and James the brother of Jesus all had some sort of real experiences that changed their lives; and d) Jesus’ tomb was found empty.

Comics have been doing a lot of growing up since the 1980’s, and the general target audience for most titles are now adults. Yeah, there are still plenty of superhero titles on the shelves, but even these have become darker and more complex, often stripping away the insecurities to show the vulnerable person behind the mask.

On one side, then, legal advice and faculty pressure suggest that Brodhead will continue with his January 7 line of wholeheartedly defending the Group of 88. At this stage, the question would seem to be whether pressure from alumni or prospective parents will force him to reconsider this approach.
I don't follow the NBA. The finals last year was as close to interested as I've been in years, and the work stoppage that followed quashed any inkling I'd had of giving a shit. Still, I can't turn on ESPLin without hearing about this Jeremy Lin dude. Personal take? It's the same without a hot rookie hitter in baseball. Once he does a once around the league, adjustments will be made, and he'll be revealed for the true quality of player he is, depending on whether he can adjust to those adjustments himself.

While each day is different overall, our mornings often start off the same. We all have breakfast and slowly gather in our homeschool room. Most mornings we start off with independent reading (though ED and I have often been up for a while so we may have already done some preschool activities together). LD loves to read so he starts reading the second he hits the kitchen. I generally have to ask DD to find a book she wants to read, then she's happily engrossed. Right now LD is reading the Lightning Thief while DD is reading a chapter or so each day from a Nancy Drew book Grams brought us.
Clear doesn't have to mean bright. Olive, brown, gray, terracotta - these can all be clear colors. Neutrals can be clear as well. If you can say for sure that it's white or cream or tan, it's probably clear. If you only use two shades to describe a color, it might be as well. Creamy white. Soft yellow. Blueish green. Once you get into three or more? Well, you'd have a hard time making a case for it being clear. I'd definitely listen to the argument, but a purpley-beige gray sounds pretty muddy to me.
Explaining the truth behind a mystery will always leave some people unsatisfied. Mystery engenders wonder; rational explanations often decimate it. This was no doubt a matter of much discussion for the Lost storytelling team as they approached the end of their epic.

So this morning I was thinking about things and realized that summer is almost HALF way over!! It made me realize that I need to continue taking advantage of things because before you know it it will be fall and I will be busy busy with school and will be wishing for those lazy days of summer...plus this may be the only summer in a long time that I will have just to hang out and actually be lazy! So I am trying to take off my gloomy, almost all my trips are over, I'm kind of bored hat and put back on my I LOVE SUMMER hat, because, why not!

A film cannot make us suspend our humanity. It can't make you enjoy violence or be 'complicit' in it. But it can guide our humanity or shut parts of it off for a couple of hours. As soon as we enter a screening we are using different rules of engagement. Different moral standards apply. We're perfectly behind a smart assassin like 'The Bride' in Kill Bill in a way we wouldn't dream of being in real life. She'd be a mass murderer. The issue is when that special receptiveness unconsciously absorbs radical things which are then, washed in that fictional varnish that hides immorality, taken out and

Use colors that you love and gravitate toward, not just what is trendy. For example, I am just not a blue person usually, so I rarely use it on walls. If I do use blue, it always is on the green end of the spectrum. Some ways of decoding your color likes are magazine pictures, looking at fabrics and noting the colors you are drawn to, looking in your closet, look outside your window at nature and observe what stands out to your eye. A beautiful shade that you love will be a joy to you forever. Don't use a color just because it is the "color du jour". I have been in housing developments where virtually every house has the same paint color. Not good.

I heard a loud roar, so I quickly opened the door and stepped outside. I could hear the ice cracking from one end of the lake to the other in several places. I have heard of thermal contraction on concrete highways, but I didn’t know it happened on ice covered bodies of water. I never imagined a noise this loud, it lifted the hair on the back of my neck.
The consequences of this catastrophe continue today, with thousands of disabled survivors suffering from the "Chernobyl syndrome" of radiation-related illnesses, and the urgent need to replace the hastily-constructed and now crumbling sarcophagus over the still-contaminated reactor.

They may not be adventures in Switzerland, but there will be

On Saturday at 15.30, from the Cathedral towards the Friedhof am Perlacher Forst, the clergy led a large procession to the graves of Alexander’s friends, the brother and sister Hans and Sophie Scholl, and Christoph Probst, executed in February 1943. They honoured the memory of prayer and a moment of silence. Then, the participants in this out-of-the-ordinary and rare phenomenon, the making of a saint from a mere mortal man, trudged through the snow-covered cemetery to the grave of Alexander Schmorell. Despite the bitter cold, the priests served a litiya, and, then, the marchers returned to the cathedral for the last Pannikhida for Alexander before his glorification. After the Vigil service, the clergy brought out the icon of the new saint and they sang the service to the new saint before it.

So again, why study economics? One of the main reasons to study economics is to develop a new way of thinking. There are basic concepts in economics that once learned help a person to observe and understand everyday choices with a whole new perspective. Economics explains fundamental concepts in decision making like opportunity cost, marginalism, and efficiencies.

These are the first three chapters. It’s very organic, but still structured. It goes up with tension, it goes down when things get resolved, sometimes it just goes straight. It’s a visualization of pacing. There’s also a separate file of each chapter that tracks the motives of the characters in their actions. Just my M.O. that seems to work.

The difficulties must have come as a surprise to Stamford Bridge players who may have felt entitled to believe they now had authority, even if it came in the shape of Roberto Di Matteo. After André Villas-Boas had been dismissed Chelsea went to almost pedantic lengths to stress that the person taking over should be viewed as a m ere caretaker. Di Matteo’s title of interim head coach might have been designed to stop him from getting over-excited.

The night before we'd talked at dinner, the four of us, about second homes - for me enticing but for the Celt, a not-so-captivating idea. For our friends, two men from London, a second home was nothing more than an extra expense, extra responsibility, etc., a dismissal so heartfelt and final I was glad I was old or wise enough not to argue. I understand all the arguments against such an establishment but, much in the way the Frick's courtyard garden attracted me because of its sense of enclosure and separation from the noise of the city, so does a small place - a recourse rather than ivory tower - surrounded by woodland, within the sound, if not the sight, of falling water, blind to the road but open to a courtyard that captures, each in its season, the fall of sun, moon, rain, snow and leaf.

“The loss of my sister has been a life long source of sorrow for me. I attribute it to the LSD and its cover up, whether the chemicals themselves ’caused’ her disintegration or not. In law this is called a ‘contributing cause.’ I learned that people cover up the most awful things, not just within a family but within communities, within universities, within ‘polite society.’ There is probably no absolute barrier that will prevent these things from being done, but they have to be exposed and called out for what they are, whenever they occur.”
As the line slowly moved forward, We found that the barriers alongside us, became metal poles and fencing, funneling the people into one direction. At one point, some of the people decided they didn’t want to be forced to go in one direction, but when they turned to go back, they found armed officers of some kind, (claiming to try and keep the peace,) pulling out their guns, and ordering those people to keep moving forward.

HOW ANOTHER MOM MAKES VEGETABLES FUN Suzy G is mother to three in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Here's how she gets her kids to eat more vegetables: "I take them to farm stands. Many farms will let the kids look around the actual farm a bit. The kids get to choose what we buy, with the agreement that they will at least try it. They have learned to love string beans (especially purple ones!), fresh-picked broccoli and purple potatoes. My son will now eat any 'lettuce' that he gets from the farm -- though he calls kale, swiss chard and spinach 'lettuce'. They've even enjoyed Brussels sprouts when they got to pick the stalk and break off the sprouts themselves. In the winter, we hit the indoor farmer's markets and they get to choose there, too!"
But it’s too late!

I picked this up when it came out with the Peacocky collection, but it is available again now, as it was repromoted in the Shop MAC, Cook MAC collection. I was set to get a few more shades since they are available now, but I used the few brain cells that haven't been obliterated by nail polish and acetone fumes, to realize I really don't need more lip gloss. This is a really great product though, the creamy colour with a bit of shine that wears so well. Defiantly pick one up if you haven't tried them yet.

It is a story told through sharing her inspiring and honest journey, which will leave you feeling kinder towards yourself and others, and more determined to live the life you are truly here to live. This delightful memoir is a courageous, life-changing book.
In the case before us, it was not shown that there was willful violation of the law, neither was it indicated that the respondents have been found guilty of negligence.
However, these days I rarely get up early enough during the work week to eat a “real” breakfast. Most of the time, my day starts off with some yogurt, a piece of fruit or something from the vending machine if anything at all. So, when trying to come up with something to make for dinner one night, TGF and I decided to do breakfast for dinner.

I’ve learned enough in these short 34 years that being present in every moment is a goal I strive for, because every moment has something beautiful and amazing to offer.
But Xianity’s not even the native religion of the North Atlantic Isles??? Celtism, Wiccanism and the Tuantha Pantheon are the TRUE faith of Scots, Welsh and Irish BEFORE the English invaded and subjugated the original faith systems and peoples (albeit beringing some tehcnology and development, that does not justify the loss of Sovereignty nor the right to destroy the original faith systems).
Well, the L is capitalized on that bottle too. I guess it is supposed to be like that? It’s not like that in my teacher’s manual. Of course, it doesn’t say in my teacher’s manual that Christopher Columbus slaughtered the Indians as soon as he got off of the boat, so you know, whatever.

We arrived at 6:30 p.m., checked on the dog, put our belongings on the kitchen counter and then went outside to the tub. As I was about to step in, I realized I still had the thank-you-for-my-Christmas-present note I had meant to leave inside.

Thus the only option for the establishment is to “double down”: more immigration, renewed Multiculturalism, and increased “tolerance”. This places the political class on a collision course with their own people.
I wake up to the hubster calling me, it's 8:15am. My little human alarm clock hasn't woken me up. I lay there thinking maybe she's catching up on all the sleep she's missed out on the past few days and nights. And then I realise, something is wrong.

Once the team is assembled, Dan is regularly invited to take two of them with him, and each have their own unique conversations with each other and our hero. Again, these exchanges are a real highlight of the experience, and show what a massive difference it makes when you bother to spend some time on your characters. If you’re going to be battling giant spider robots with people, it’s better they be people that you actually like, right?

I will admit that I'm in the minority with my review. Most of the reviews that I've read were much more positive (I'm talking 4 to5 stars). Should I have given the book another 100 pages? Maybe. But for now, I've set this book aside. Unfortunately, descriptions of wetlands and the decision of whether to drain them or not took over the majority of the 200+ pages that I read. I'm sure that Eleanor Glanville lead an interesting life ... I just wish there was less marshy descriptions involved in telling her story.

Just a quick update to say the 11 miles (well, actually 10.8) went well. I took it very slow, but at least got it done and didn't feel too horrible afterwards despite the full fledged head cold. The best part about running with a head cold is running works like an anti-histamine so you can actually breathe when you run!

They push their panties with all the angels a man can dream up, even though I am sure devils would be more comfortable in the product they are pushing! No, this is not a rant about scantily clad models flashing their over-processed bodies at me and my family.

When it comes to quality beaches with good lake views, you can practically take your pick here. I visited no less than five beaches during my hike. I have two favorite beaches to recommend. The first is only about a five-minute walk from the parking lot on Church Street that is located across from the trailhead. (The lot also serves the Laurel Bluff Trail.) It is a broad beach with a nice view over some mud flats with a sparse covering of grass. The second beach, which is about 10 minutes into the hike, is at a bend in the lake. It offers excellent views in two directions and has a crude wooden bench/platform that is a great spot to stop for lunch. I spend several minutes here watching a trio of swallowtail butterflies.
I would love to know...what are some of your favorite things??
A wonderful emotion to get things moving when one is stuck is anger. It was anger more than anything else that had set me off, roused me into productivity and creativity.
Jordan Hasay (Oregon) defeated Kathy Kroeger (Stanford) for the girls Pac-10 title. How many times did we see these two go back and forth at past FL Nationals?! Stanford was able to take the team title on both sides.
. I have to say the Payden foundation knows how to treat their riders. At the picnic there were full body massages! Massage therapists donated their time, brought their tables, and bravely massaged the tired sweaty cyclists. All in all it was a very fabulous experience that should be repeated yearly.
On another note, while I was doing research I discovered there is a band called Bog Spavin. Their logo is "rock out with your hock out". It was disturbing to me.
So, as a friend once wisely told me - "They never treat you better than on the first date." - this probably was an indication that things were going to go downhill from here.

About the warranty, we paid a little extra and got the whole warranty extended to 100k miles, so it's not just drive train coverage.

Chris's mom expected him to study hard, go to college, be a doctor or a lawyer. I tease him that he didn't become a lawyer; he married one instead. His partner, Bill, is an attorney in Washington, DC, and if that wasn't scary enough to me, he's also white. And Republican. Yikes! White Men in Suits! Republicans in DC! I was prepared not to like him very much, but, as it so often goes with our narrow-minded stereotypes, I had to completely change my mind as soon as I met Bill. He's a totally nice guy, funny and charming, completely supportive of Chris and his work in the way that makes you believe the whole leftt-brained needs right-brained way: I think sometimes people with really left-brained kinds of careers really benefit when they have someone whose work is at the other end of the spectrum. It's kind of simplistic to put it that way, but if you're spending your days around people who are maybe kind of analytical in their approach to things, I think it's got to be so calming to come home to another kind of thinking. And vice versa, of course. Their home is filled with wonderful art--it's like a gallery, and you keep seeing things you missed the first time around.

The problem is, as a society, we still have not imagined a way of organising work that accommodates the truth of our lives. We work in jobs that often don’t produce tangible things and the proxies for performance have become long hours in the workplace. In a toxic climate of individualism we see children, and in fact any form of dependence, as some abhorrent condition that must be hidden from view.
I’ve had to come to God often with my frustration, fears and wants. I have found that trusting in Him to meet my needs and take care of things leads to less crying on my part and a happier home. I’ve found more rest in that than in stewing about what I think is unfair treatment and repeatedly complaining about what I don’t like. I’ve certainly tried both options.
Fortunately, when milking fresh coconut, you can control for this - simply use the milk/second extraction for general cooking on higher heat, then add the cream/first extraction at the very end of cooking (or after you've turned off the heat) as a thickener.
And just like having the bad habit of thinking negative thoughts - NOW your brain starts to retrain itself and will only remember what 'it sees', what you put in front of it (what you are thinking about and watching!)
An individual with Autism’s difficulties in communication (in my experience) is the one that makes day-to-day activities challenging. For instance, a student with Autism might burst out crying in the middle of a lesson in school because he/she is tired or bored. In extreme instances, individuals with Autism may physically hurt another person just because they wore a different pair of shoes which unsettlled them. in other cases, people with ASC may not speak at all (either by choice or not). I know that these are extreme, bordering on ‘stereotypical’ and I acknowledge that not every single person with Autism will behave in these ways. These are just examples.
7. Ideas don’t hit you in the shower. Ideas are the result of a lot of iterations. Ideas in the social space are often combinations of other ideas. Allowing ideas to mix and fold with each other with an eye on the problem space, allows more useful solutions to come to mind. Sharing and discussing ideas is part of the process, also getting the ideas in front of people is critical to knowing if you have something they may want to use. The first idea is not going to be the last one, you will have many ideas. It is important to explore the solution space. Certain themes will follow you. You will find yourself attracted to certain problems and ideas. Teach yourself the skills that help you grow in that domain of knowledge, try out ideas and explore. It will not be an overnight success but will evolve over time, often years. Most companies are not overnight successes. Make sure you know what question are you answering. It never gets easier or less busy, it is a lifetime commitment, so make sure you love what you are doing. It is a good attitude to realize that things change and it helps to be excited by those challenges and alterations from the original course. It helps to think about smaller goals than the end goal. Look to the next hill not the destination.

Each nightmare realm, each infernal prison is host to a seemingly infinite number of damned things. They writhe and bite and scratch and bleed and howl hoping that some mortal will be foolish enough to create a link between this world and theirs. Were a mortal to view this hellish-gullet, they would perceive these screeching hordes as a flowing mass of indistinguishable bodies. This belies the truth, for there are demons - if only a few - that are truly individual.*

But what that means is you’re really living on the edge that first season. You want to always be ahead, have a few scripts in the bank ready to go, but not too many because things could change. And you sure don’t want to go week-to-week with writing new scripts because then you wind up in a cardiac ward or the Unibomber’s shed.
Honestly, I pray for and think of so many of you-- Ron (Mom & Dad), Barbara, Cheri... many more of you. I was just saying prayers of thanks, this morning, for my son's six months of sobriety. That's definitely debatable, because some people believe that if you are using methadone then you are not sober. As far as I am concerned, my son is not buying heroin. He's using methadone at a clinic that has a good reputation for dispensing this, in liquid form, and adhering to the state of California's very strict guidelines.

During the convention we were at dinner one night and someone started talking about her experience on the maternity floor at the hospital.

In both the Nimrod and Snatch Land Rover cases the use of old, outdated or inappropriate equipment was key, but in the Nimrod case there was no other intervening action; equipment failure led directly to the deaths. In the Land Rover cases, there had to be the intervening action of an IED. It seems inequitable and distasteful that the Ministry of Defence should be able to evade liability in the Land Rover cases on this basis. However, this may be about to change, following the brave decision of Mr Justice Owen, who, on 30 June 2011, rejected an application by the Ministry of Defence to strike out a claim on the basis of combat immunity, at least in respect of this negligent procurement argument (Smith & Others v Ministry of Defence [2011] EWHC 1676 (QB)).

We had to change up the itinerary a bit because of the weather. We stuck mostly to the original plan, but had the kids set up the army men upon arrival instead of doing the paper airplanes. We had to scratch the obstacle course because the ground was so wet, but were able to do everything else...just a little bit out of order. We don't have pictures of 'Drill Sergeant Says' or the 'Parachute Games' because I forgot to hand off the camera until after the parachute. Thanks to Papa for the birthday party photos!

Good health. I want my kids to be healthy, physically, nutritionally, mentally and emotionally. I want them to like a wide variety of foods, to experiment with foods, and to love to cook. Food is such a big part of our lives, we love to try new things from all over the world. I want my kids to like to be active. Walking, riding bike, sports, anything that gets them moving. Being active keeps you at a good weight, helps you be healthier, reduces arthritis, blood pressure problems, etc.

The 1912 building permit was to the Ricketts Amusement Co and the architect was E W Houghton, a Seattle-based architect originally born in Hampshire in England. Ricketts, who came from the same county, was the former lesee of CPR’s Opera House (just down the street from the building, and despite its title, a mainstream theatre). Ricketts probably ceased connections with the building before its completion; he managed the Imperial Theatre before retiring in 1915. The 1913 opening saw the Kinemacolor Theatre offering movies, in colour – the first Canadian theatre with the system. Kinemacolor was invented by English cinematographer George Albert Smith, and marketed by American entrepreneur Charles Urban. Film was run through a projector at 32 frames per second, twice the normal speed, and then filtered through red and green coloured lenses to produce “the world’s wonders in nature’s colours.” A nine-piece orchestra accompanied the short films, and a baritone named George C. Temple “delighted the audience with some of the old songs.” Later, the theatre added a $10,000 organ to accompany the silent movies. The cinema failed to thrive, and was closed in 1914. The sign for the cinema remained however – perhaps because it’s 7 feet high and 13 feet wide. It mysteriously disappeared when the building was torn down in 1972 to make way for the Pacific Centre Mall, only to reappear in the Keg restaurant on Thurlow at Alberni, before it ended up removed from there too.

A few days ago I posted about how good I was at procrastinating, and how I was having trouble motivating myself without a deadline. Some of you were kind enough to come back to me a couple of days later and ask me how I’d been getting on, and I had indeed managed 1,400 words. I haven’t written anything else on that particular project since, as editing is hard and requires brain power, but I’m working on a new writing project (a murder mystery involving contract killers and some incredibly red herrings), of which I’ve written 1,813 at the time of working on this post.

Stated simply, I didn't realize what I was missing. While the US version is the meatier prospect, song for song, and displays to fuller effect the humanity, humor and reach of the band (adding the excellent- and free- bonus single, it sets the stage for London Calling), The UK edition is the one for me. There's an immediacy here that is unparalleled in the annals of Rock, a low-fi fury of tightly wound working-class frustration, sulphate-driven riffing (Mick Jones- guitar HERO), and the rabid bark of THE quintessential acquired taste in Rock vocals. The Clash is an attestation to the disaffected, a permission slip to act up (which I took literally for the next twenty years) and ask questions (ditto- plus ten). And the hooks were there all along. When I listen to this record now, I can see the boy who became the man, and hear the voice of Strummer reminding that boy that he is not alone.

Here's one of my favorite choral groups - the Ray Charles Singers. Lately I just haven't been able to get enough of the different choral groups - there just isn't enough time in the day to listen to all the records I want to hear! Besides the fact that this record is by the Ray Charles Singers, I bought it for the cover art, and because it's by Command Records. I don't have too many of the Command Records, but I find that I'm starting to look out for these more and more. One thing I did find puzzling about this particular record is that both the cover and the label say "Stereo", but when I recorded it I didn't see that there were two different tracks. And in some of the songs, the men's voices sound kind of "distant". I'm wondering if maybe the record could have been mislabeled. Odd. Anyway, I still enjoyed this album, especially "Quiet Nights", which is one of my all-time favorite songs. And any album that has "Dominique" on it is fine by me!
In the cup, they were off-shoot by the Llamados and the Talk ‘n Text who competed in seven games for the championship. How I wish it was the Kings who competed in the championship. But honestly, the championship in the said cup is one of the best games I had ever watched. I also felt the same heart beat whenever I am watching the Kings on the hard court.

After the material world information I add the social media, but only if it’s for the photography business. I do not like to contact photographers via their personal accounts unless they’ve specifically redirected me there, otherwise I feel like it’s an invasion of privacy to some extent. Social media outlets like facebook, twitter, LinkedIn, Google+, newsletters, blogs, vimeo and flickr are all great places for social media connections where people expect you to contact them if they have a page there. If you have to dig too hard to find it or if it’s not already listed on their website, they don’t really want you connecting there.

One of my story toons, Amaeris is part of the Wolfsbane family. So generally, my goal is just to get her to Level 20. I am also enjoying using her to put together outfits. She currently still has her Mastiff, Junkyard, so as we all know, she is in need of a new pet…
At the same time, wine consumption in the UK rose by 8%, and the average ABV of wine rose from 12% ABV to 13.5%.
It's just . . . unfair. I cannot conceive of another word. The whole thing is unfathomable.
Peoples Organic might be new in town, but it’s no stranger to gluten-free foods. Owner Lynn Gordon previously founded French Meadow Bakery, a certified-organic bakery known for its line of gluten-free breads (in addition to vegan, yeast-free and kosher breads). At this Galleria café, any of the sandwiches, along with the wraps, can be served on gluten-free bread or in a gluten-free tortilla upon request. The Rachel ($9.95) is made with natural, oven-roasted turkey, Swiss cheese and sauerkraut, with Thousand Island dressing.
Hello Girls,
The film stars Sean Rogerson, your good self, Ashleigh Gryzko, Mackenzie Gray and Merwin Mondesir – with The Vicious Brothers onboard as directors – what was it like working with the cast and crew on-set? Any good anecdotes?
I personally think that learned men such as Maggs and Hromnik have deliberately avoided the issue of Black Slavery in their theories, not only because of the worldwide negative stigma attached to the term, but also because of the ruthless persecution-tactics of the Marxist-inspired South African government, and their craving for land. I believe there is already sufficient evidence to show that the various stone structures are a combination of cattle kraals, human dwellings, food storage facilities, sacred (Hindu) temples, and lastly --- prison holding-cells for hordes of gold-digging slaves, who were forced by their masters to stay in the region against their will!
The format of the book is largely lists, bullet points, and short paragraphs. It’s laid out in such a way that it’s very easy to navigate and titles are relatively short too. Roberts has a lot of statistics and numbers in this book, which make it a lot easier to sift through for someone without much time and the numbers are all very consistent. What I look for whenever I see someone throwing around statistics is consistency. A lot of authors will use statistics in one place but not the other all for the sake of dramatizing a point they’re making. 1.2% doesn’t sound like much, but if that translates to 32,000,000 a lot of authors will prefer to use the big number for the shock value. Roberts though keeps everything consistent. If he cited a percentage two sentences ago, he will cite a percentage later in the paragraph. I don’t see a lot of games in his writing, which makes his claims come across as being more meaningful. Upon doing research of my own, I did find several different findings for any one thing he cited (for example, percentage of clicks by page rank). The findings all fall within a very tight range (a 5-10% difference between all findings), of which Roberts tends to cite more conservative figures. Meaning, he tends to cite statistics on the lower end of the range. That isn’t a bad thing and might even be beneficial to a business professional who is looking to maximize the results of their marketing efforts.

Young job seekers often complain about a catch-22. Employers want to see work experience on the resume, but how can they get it when no one will hire them?

I had language class in the morning. I’m starting to understand really basic things like how to say numbers, dates, and basic info about people. I can say “hey, my name is Nic” “chào, tôi tên là Nic.”

After that parable are teachings about not serving money and divorce. Much (and I mean much) can be said regarding these things, especially divorce, but in this context I simply want to say that God’s people were to be faithful. Faithful in their business and financial dealings. Faithful to God. Faithful in marriage.
She has so much coming up, (confirmation, orchestra trips, youth group, piano recital,) - all she really wants is for it all to be over and done with. I know that she is very much looking forward to some 'R&R' over summer break. (Me, too!)
Before class cut crepe paper into 2 feet lengths. Divide your students into teams and give them each a straw and a piece of crepe paper. Have them use the straw to blow the crepe paper across the room and back. If you don’t want them to get on the floor, have them blow the crepe across a table.

A tremendous outpouring of community compassion and support followed, including 1,500 children’s books donated at his funeral for Cincinnati Children’s. A book drive on last year’s Day of Caring in Richmond, held on what would have been Tressel’s first birthday, generated 2,000 books for all Wayne County K through second graders.

Many paths lead to the bottom of the hill – an infinite number, speaking mathematically, but for our purposes, we’ll say it’s 3 or 4 – and at the bottom of each path lies one of the many traditions, values, and institutions that we have left behind in the name of progress. Among these are the traditional religion and spirituality of our parents and grandparents, the rural and agrarian structure of society, and the tight-knit community, home, and family of our ancestors.
Rather than let fear rule how she reacted to Georgia’s diagnosis, she instead chose to circle the wagons and fight like hell. Here are just a FEW examples of the efforts she led to kick cancer’s ass:
It isn’t as conscious as that, but I’m yeah there’s some influence drawn from that tradition, simply because we’ve come from a background of listening to a lot of those bands.

I approach my yoga classes with strong intention: To take a full hour to quiet my mind and strengthen my body and soul. I walk in, turn off my phone and step onto the mat knowing I will focus only on my own well being for the duration of the class. I always leave a class feeling refreshed and calm which is the state I wish I could enjoy more often than I do these days. Much like life in general, I have a deep respect for yoga even though I am still a beginning student even after over a decade of attending classes. Even though I have a strong desire to dive deeper and study the roots of yoga, I seem to stay at the surface of the practice and enjoy the shallow benefits that I can feel within a one hour class.
But despite all that.....
Bidding on Ebay takes patience. A lot of patience. When I started bidding, I either didn't go high enough, or I watched in amazement as prices skyrocketed. Then I saw something odd. Naked dolls didn't fare too poorly at auction, and complete ones were pricey. But the dolls that had part of their kit seemed to sell for less. I watched some more and bid on a Samantha that had her "meet" dress, but the wrong shoes and no tights. Her hair was a mess, but she had a hardback book. So I went looking elsewhere on Ebay and found shoes and tights. All in all, I spent less than $70, plus some time. While this is not a tremendous savings off the the $110 retail cost, it is a huge savings off of the cost of a "mint" condition Samantha. I probably also would have saved money if I had been shopping in the summer instead of October, which is coming up on Christmas. I also would have saved money if I had been content with a doll that is still being produced. In addition, if I were willing to restring the doll (and good instructions are out there) the cost would be even lower.

In the 2006 business year, which ran from 7/1/06 to 6/30/07, DDDB raised significantly more money, likely because it recruited a high-profile advisory board announced 5/8/06 and because Atlantic Yards received significant public attention, given the enviromental review process, official approval of the project, and first round of lawsuits.

Burn Notice returns for its fourth season Thursdays at 9/8c on USA Network (here’s our Recap & Review!). The #1 scripted series on cable stars Jeffrey Donovan, Gabrielle Anwar, Bruce Campbell, and Sharon Gless. The action-packed season four commences with a new counterintelligence expert, Jesse Garcia, played by Coby Bell (Third Watch), who loves to fight bad guys just as much as Michael does.
It should be obvious that, given the above records, frigatebirds also can be seen away from the ocean in Texas. However, even though it is not considered all that unusual to see frigatebirds along the Texas coast or in pelagic regions (Mlodinow characterizes them as uncommon, but not rare, summer visitors), records of the birds more than fifty miles from the coast “are exceedingly scarce.” All these records occurred in the fall and “were related to hurricane or tropical storm activity.”

(103) Consider the following: (1) Hebrew verbs express not the time of an action but rather whether the specified action is complete or incomplete. Tenses can usually be fairly easily assigned to such verbs, although less easily in prophetic writings, where there are rapid shifts back and forth among past, present, and future. But in assigning tenses, translators will often choose to leave unexpressed the completeness/incompleteness element because English has only awkward ways to handle that. (2) Hebrew displays much less subordination of one clause to another than does English, and in general it lacks our great variety of words that indicate logical connections between clauses and phrases. In Hebrew narrative, sentence units tend to be strung out one after another in boxcar fashion and to be hooked together by means of a single, all-purpose connective that is usually translated “and” in the KJV. . . . Then would represent the Hebrew connective not merely with “and” but with “when,” “but,” “however,” and so on (depending on context) or at times would simply omit it. (3) Greek verbs indicate time of action more definitely than Hebrew verbs do, but they also indicate nature of action (whether linear, recurring, or completed). Greek verbs are thus very complete in meaning, and translators who attempt to capture all of the potential meaning will risk overloading their English and producing a translation so clumsy as to be unreadable.

During the hard snows and frosts of winter – that in northern Scotland and pockets of Europe lasted until spring equinox – Britain went through a series of threats from companies in conflict with employment unions – with aviation and transportation strikes imminent – until intervention by a well-meaning Icelandic volcano moved the goalposts.
We had a mad dash to the Random House party on the Sunday night with time only for one (the first of many) glass of prosecco. Then to dinner at old favourite Trattoria del Rosso and a satisfying chat about the novel that Lucy's agent would be selling at the Fair.
This information has provided rather useful during emergency response events. The interface with Google Earth is quite nice. I was able to search for a latitude/longitude to see if the Texas Civil Air Patrol had taken aerial photos of a couple of areas we were concerned about.

As for the diet: we are still sticking to it. We cheated yesterday, Valentine’s Day, for beans and flour tortillas on our tacos. It was delicious though. Also to clear some confusion, we do eat potatoes, mostly sweet potatoes, but we try to limit them to once a week. Corn and beans are a big no-no though. I still really miss coke and bread, but whatever. I did make eggplant parmesan today, an it was quite delicious (although we found out after consumption that the sauce has sugar in it, boo). Instead of flour, I used almond ‘flour,’ which is just ground up almonds.
He had seen his dream of eventually creating an American Revolution-style federation between all the newly independent republics, with a government ideally set-up solely to recognize and uphold individual rights, succumb to the pressures of particular interests throughout the region, which rejected that model and allegedly had little or no allegiance to classical liberal principles.
There could be no grosser misconception of the realities than is entertained by those who vociferously demand legislation as they call it "against discrimination". The discrimination and the deprivation, the sense of alarm and of resentment, lies not with the immigrant population but with those among whom they have come and are still coming.

As it happens, I was on the train when I finished the book. It was a beautiful ending to a beautiful book. I didn't care that the train was crowded, and I was sitting in a seat directly facing strangers. I smiled to myself, closed the book slowly, and then reopened it to the first page, where my mother had written her name 18 years earlier. I ran my index finger across her name and sighed.
Out of the blue she tells me she wants to shoot a turkey. Now, she’s been shooting with me before on a few occasions and has genuinely enjoyed herself. (She’s not a bad shot either!) But she had never expressed any interest in hunting…actually killing something. And I’d never asked her to go.

It's the small details that make up the whole.
And starting today, the VIDA Women in Literary Arts website is publishing, a day at a time, a tribute essay written by a female American poet. Appropriately titled "21 Love Poems to Adrienne Rich," the feature will run through April 30. Today's essay is by Adrienne Su and is titled "What's in a Name." I can hardly wait to read all of them!
It’s good to count our blessings; all those good things in our lives — both big and small. Bob Gass listed some in a recent Word for Today.
As you'll see in part 2, we changed our lighting, flooring, cabinets (not just the doors), layout, countertops and appliances. It was pretty much an overhaul.
Once I got to the shop, I only took a photo of one of them. I will get the others while they are hanging. This one is called Color, Color and More Color. I still need to write the pattern for it. Remember that the center of the quilt is a panel, not pieced. Just the borders are pieced. I used orange Cuddle on the back and it turned out very cute and warm.

Sorry, though… Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers are both JUST as amazingly crafted as their Oscar-Winning brother, The Return of the King. Some would argue that they’re more tightly edited, since everyone seems to point out the silly multiple endings of ROTK. If you stated that Two Towers was the actual best of the 3 movies, I’d have a tough time disagreeing.
My goal for April was to end up under $9,000. I made it by $175 (cue: wild cheers and applause again). My goal for May is to end up under $7,800. That means a minimum loan payment of $1,025. Hopefully my new work priorities will start paying off (literally) and I’ll see a rise in my monthly income. Perhaps I’ll even get to Harry Potter World this year****.
Wowza's! I can't believe how my little blog has been neglected over the last month. I've come to realize that I'm an all or nothing kinda girl and lately it's been nothing.

I started quite late so I probably won't get around to all of them but here are a few...

In Mary’s room, the closet door has been caught on tape moving on its own, as if it were violently kicked from within. EMF detectors left on the bed will suddenly begin to spike, things will move, and occasionally a sulfuric smell will engulf the room just before all activity ceases.

But what is the US view of the world as it is? Clinton gave a clue to the US’s understanding of the global pecking order, and South Africa’s policy makers should have no illusions about where South Africa fits in.
Before he defeated John McCain, Barak Obama surpassed the Apple iPhone. The Association of National Advertisers awarded the now-president-elect its "Marketer of The Year" award. The subsequent election victory should thus be seen as the gold ribbon certifying what the ANA already recognized. The success of Sen. Obama's campaign of slogans and "soaring rhetoric" made an impression on a small country which watched the U.S. election with understandable interest.

I just bought these, so I wanted to test them out. I checked out the instructions that came with them, did the little pinch, and I looked back at the chart and holy shit, 26% body fat! I didn’t realize how fat of a fuck I was. I checked a couple more times, but the number never changed. I then realized that I was reading the chart for women and all was well with the world once more. According to the men’s scale, I’m at 16%, so there’s definitely still work to be done.

Someone you thought was amazing, and someone that you believed also thought you were amazing, has left you. How could they have done this to you? Didn't they know how much you loved them? When you made it clear to them that you'd do anything for them so that you could be together, didn't they take that seriously? It just doesn't seem possible that they'd have chosen someone else over you. It certainly doesn't seem possible that they'd sought out someone else to replace you.
Another tradition is to remove a berry every time you kiss someone under the mistletoe. When there are no more berries, there are no more kisses for you, buster. I'm sure there's also some lore connected with the kiss corresponding to the final berry will be the kiss you share with your future wife.
As I got the understanding of her rainbow ladder sticking straight up from the middle of the golden dome of energy, I had to take a look at her. As I said, she was standing at the very top of the ladder… with a feeling of… waiting. There really wasn’t anywhere else to go. I could see nothing above her or around her that would indicate “go here, go there,” but a detail was added to her imagery. She had a little sparrow in her hand. Altho the rungs of her ladder were in directly alignment with the east and west direction, I watched as she was facing the north… her right side and was getting ready to set this bird free for flight. I had to look up sparrow and then just smiled as I looked at the first few sentences: Sparrow aids in opening the eyes to our self-worth and instills dignity and empowerment. He teaches the importance of voice and communication and the timing of exertion and retreat. It is time to sing your song in all that you do.
Teachers would have a greater chance at observing and identifying abuse if they had the same awareness and prevention information. In fact the entire school should be required to have the same information. Therefore, I believe that all degree and certificate programs should require a teacher to be certified in a course albeit continuing education or part of obtaining their degree to include child sexual abuse education.
Anyway, in one way or another, the idea that authors getting friends and family to review/rate their books on Amazon and Goodreads is wrong crops up a few times. Of course it is, I'm not disputing that whatsoever, but it got me thinking about a few things that are only slightly related, and I wanted to ask what people's views on them were. And so here we have a discussion!
The three of us are very different in appearance; we could be the three leads for a television series that cast its characters with political correctness in mind, LOL. Greg is white with short reddish brown hair and dresses tastefully Goth. He has been a solitary practitioner of Vodou and Hoodoo for a number of years (not sure exactly how long). Robert is black with dreadlocks and dressed casually for the occasion. He is Pagan and somewhat new to Vodou. I am Asian/Inuit with medium length wavy hair and dressed semi-casually, formerly Wiccan and have only been studying Vodou seriously for about a year.
Here is the Nation News report on Thursday’s public meeting about the Chancery Lane / Long Beach project. Generally not a bad piece of reporting by the Nation.

In the meantime, seeing our son so interested in everything his dad does and proudly learning various tasks makes my heart hurt. In a world where technology has trumped nearly everything, I find myself crossing my fingers that he stays interested in using his hands to create, manipulate and produce things. Using those same hands to bang out on a keyboard is fine, too. I’m not anti-tech (unless the internet is being putzy, which it was this morning as I tried to finish up this post, then yes, I was fully anti-tech!) but my hope for him is that he winds up wanting to build “stuff” instead of building websites.

We are presented with what is literally a desert island, and as if the narrator has fundamentally misunderstood the science of marketing, to his mind the glamour and enchantment of his product lies in its desolation. The isles are inevitably mis-sold to us – we are promised that only “reptile life” is to be found on the Encantadas, and that “no voice, no low, no howl is heard; the chief sound of life here is a hiss.” It will eventually transpire, however, that there are plenty of men and beasts upon the isles, leaving us to wonder at this Aesopian fable against commodity fetishism, in which a talented salesman has been enchanted to promote death and despair as attractive products. With the quick wit and beady eye of a smooth-talking travel agent, the narrator regales us with some of his islands’ enchantments:
All in all these options fostered roleplaying, which is nice. While playing my Bounty Hunter, for example, I could make decisions based on how I feel my character would operate in the game world — I chose to have him be the sort who does not deviate from his employer’s instructions, and any time an NPC presented an alternative offer I either refused it. I could have also played my character as the opportunist, who was only interested in credits and would backstab his employer if it earned him more cash. Plus, there were times when I could refuse or accept offers in a cruel or kind manner, allowing me to further personalize my character: he ended up adhering to his contracts’ stipulations, and would kill if the bounty called for it, but otherwise would not be excessively ruthless. A “capture or kill” would have him lean heavily toward “capture.”
We were able to pull the man of the hour aside for a few moments and talk about the beginnings of his success, some of his proudest moments, as well as his influences and inspirations.

私が特に気に入ったのはこの彫刻とジャーク・タティのシルエットとアクリル塗料で描いたこの不思議な顔の絵とこの鶏の面白い肖像でした。 Among many works, I was particularly drawn towards these sculptures, Jaques Tati’s silhouette, this mysterious looking face painted in acrylic, and those delightful chicken’s portraits.
In a bowl, combine the chicken mince, onion, breadcrumbs, egg, coriander and spices. Get handfuls of the mixture (roughly 1/4 cup worth) and shape into slightly flattened sausage shapes. Insert skewer. Make all koftas. Place koftas on tray; cover and refridgerate for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, cook koftas in a pan until cooked through, say 15 minutes. Serve with walnut sauce, crispy potatoes and salad.
Zoe, with an allusion to Bergson and his notions of concrete and abstract time, tries to render the forces within our social terrain visible and remove the confusion that Bergson would constantly refer to in his ideas on time, matter, and memory. Strauss wants the viewers of these pieces to be realized and to know that they are existent because they truly are. The viewers experiences juxtaposed with those in the photographs renders this distinction more real. For the viewer, they become a part of this coming into existence as they travel through the spatial enunciation of this identity recorded in a visually material literature. A material language that is read through their active participation in the construction of these spaces meaning and recording in history. To turn this image on its head and give voice to those who in society were told that their voice could only be validated through certain schema or blocks in the social terrain of human experience.

Okay, so, I’m going to start my new blog series on ‘Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban’ today, and thanks to everybody who voted in the poll. Since it’s a fairly short book with a lot of small chapters, I’ll try to cover 2-3 chapters a week, and maybe finish in eight installments or so.
Thank goodness for free Wi-Fi sites. I’m sure you find them convenient and sometimes even necessary. I’m happy to be able to duck into a library or nice coffee shop that displays a free Wi-Fi sign in the window and get some work done while between appointments.

Sam and Abby pushed their way through the crowd, acknowledging good wishes on all sides. A judge slipped a medal just like Abby's around Sam's neck, and the weight of it felt wonderful - the weight of success. Sam's teammates hugged her so tightly that even the three bands she'd wrapped around her dark curls weren't enough to keep them under control. They popped out all around her face in a messy halo.
The movie stars Lloyd Nolan, in his second of seven appearances as Michael Shayne, so it's pretty obvious that he - a private detective - is the hero of the piece. The twisted thing about this is that in the book, the private detective, appropriately named Izzard, is the only true villain. While the other eleven main characters are motivated by some small sense of honor, Izzard is ready and willing to become (if he isn't already) a cold blooded killer. Of an innocent woman, no less.

OK well let's get it started. Here is a layout that I completed a while back. This was one of my daughter's senior pictures that I took in 2009. Don't laugh, but it was taken at the Wyoming Territorial Prison. We were on vacation out west, which is where I took her senior pictures. I loved this picture of her looking into the mirror.

I found myself, at times, alongside people who had stopped to have a proper chat, but these weren't always that fruitful. It's not easy to pick a particular phrase when you have the full conversation, and being given context and background makes those phrase less inspiring. The best ones were snippets overheard from people walking past, mid-conversation: "People come and talk to me.", "I'll ring that lot and tell them we'll just leave it.", "And then it goes all criss-cross which is why I like it."

It is nice to see it is not raining with a hint of blue sky. Went out to feed & Remington's blanket still looked to be in good shape. Took a look at the round pen and sighed. MUD & PUDDLES! Makes me so unhappy. At least it is only a few inches deep so far. I am excited to be getting a load of chips this weekend to dump in the round pen. Hopefully that will slow down the mud issue long enough for Spring to finally get here. That just means Orion and I are going have lots of work to do. I'm sure Zane will want to help. I will have to find him a small shovel or gardening trowel. It may just be too muddy to back the trailer into the round pen. Knock on wood I don't get stuck. Ha Ha.

I'm not sure we needed to hear this. It only made me more nervous. But I recognized that this was Joe, here, revealing to himself the incredible position he'd been invited into. He only wanted to impart what an important project this was. As it was Steve's assignment, I felt I was somewhat out of the loop. I was, and still am not, a filmmaker, and was primarily just a fan. I had to remind myself, in that moment, how lucky I was. My mind was being blown, in other words.

“It appears that many misconstrue ‘frugality’ with ‘miserly’ which means to compromise, be stingy and parsimonious, connoting unhappiness in saving money. To be frugal, by simple definition, is to not be wasteful,” she explains. “By living thrift, we are not depraved.”
According to this passage, we are to examine ourselves, and investigate our walk with utmost care. I pray for wisdom and discernment as much as possible. To be wise is to walk watchfully, looking at and carefully examining everything with which we come in contact. As far as discernment goes, it is also something that we must diligently pray for and practice. As we walk circumspectly to investigate and examine everything we are being discerning. When we walk this way, we will know what the will of the Lord is and obey it. We will be pilots who know the way. We will know where we are going and why. We will know what we believe and why we believe it. On the other hand, those who do not walk circumspectly are like the pilot who does not know what port he is heading for. To him, no wind is the right wind. Isn’t that what the post-modern mindset says that there are no absolutes? We must walk circumspectly irregardless of what the world thinks or does.

Unfortunately, a real problem arises in a democracy, because many people, perhaps most, will want to move in the most positive sounding direction regardless of how it flies in the face of the reasonable facts. If these ill informed, hope driven people are the majority then the whole community will be guided by irrational hope and their collective actions will be no better than a riotous mob’s. What is a fair minded person to do when they find themselves being driven into a chaos of obvious disaster? What are we to do when nearly all of our present population of seven billion people are eagerly heading into the inevitable over-population boom and its equally inevitable population bust? I don’t know! The only reasonable thing is to prepare for the after effects of the coming disaster and prepare for a resurgence of humanity. When obvious things have passed over it may be possible to rebuild humanity on a more permanent foundation of a World Constitution with as its goal the long term survival of the human species rather than the short term maximization of personal gain. Give the people of the future the tools they need to form an equitable sustainable society. That would include a World Constitution and the seeds to replant the world.
This past weekend the Texas State meet certainly didn't disappoint. Lutz ran away from the field, and a very good field at that, for a 14:45 to 15:08 win over Mark Pinales (Round Rock Stony Point). Parker Stinson won the bronze with a time of 15:11. The Woodlands boys picked up right where they left off when Dan Green retired and handed the program to son Juris, they won. The Woodlands outdistanced Region II foes Klein Oak and Cedar Park for the win. The interesting story was 4a winner Boerne Champion who easily won 4a (30-120 over El Paso Jefferson) and would have beaten The Woodlands based on an integrated race. This showdown looms big as Nike South approaches.

Not to mention that Nintendo’s focus is, first and foremost, creating quality games. They likely wouldn’t take part in anti-used schemes. If the Wii U ends up being a threat to the PS4 and the 720, they’d be killing themselves by blocking used games without overcompensating in another area for it. And even if it’s not, you have a game of chicken here. If either Sony or Microsoft decides against it, whichever side that actually implements such a system loses immediately. And because of that, I doubt either of them will do it. Microsoft, if either of them.

Anyone whose has a cable subscription to IFC probably recognizes Carrie Brownstein from her comedic stylings on the channel’s popular show Portlandia. Yet, fewer may know that Brownstein currently plays guitar for Wild Flag or along with Corin Tucker founded seminal Pac NW rock group Sleater Kinney. Formed in 1994, Sleater Kinney (the band functioned as a three piece and had three different drummers over the course of its existence) has often been pegged as part of the Riot Grrrl Movement. However, if one reads Sara Marcus’s engaging Girls to the Front: The True Story of the Riot Grrrl Revolution, Sleater Kinney appears to be the belated second wave of the movement, a culmination of its best intentions if you will. This is not to say Sleater Kinney’s connection has somehow been fabricated or imagined, but rather after reading GTTF, it would seem the “formal” movement imploded just as its effects, example #1 Sleater Kinney, began to emerge. Sure, Corin Tucker played in one of the quintessential RG acts of the early 1990s, Heavens to Betsy, but the musicianship and lyrical depth that Sleater Kinney exhibited probably would have developed on its own. Yet, it would be hard to deny that RG gave it a solid foundation upon which to build and space in which dominate.
Evans and the company which he works for are nothing but wannabe gangsters who if there really is such a thing as “karma” will at some time in future find themselves in a position whereby they come to realise how fucked up in the head they are, especially if someone can take advantage of them whilst they themselves are in need of assistance through illness, as I said in a previous post - what goes round, comes round.
I'd put Patrick Rothfuss in the Robert Jordan, George RR Martin, Melanie Rawn school of epic fantasy. If the first book in this series (The Name of the Wind) was good, then the second is even better. The canvas is broad, the imagination on a similar scale, and I particularly like the central framework of Kvothe's inn as the pivot around which the whole story revolves. There's a sort of zen-like quality to him which reminds me of 'Young Grasshopper's' teachers, Master Po and Master Kan in the Kung Fu movies. Rothfuss is just a damn good storyteller - the only complaint I have is that I want to read on, and I can't, because the next book won't be out for aeons. However, as a fellow writer, I understand that it takes time for fantasy worlds to brew and come to the boil, so I forgive him. If you are a patient sort, do try him out - I think this series will be seen as a classic in years to come.
The idea of the invention of language and of the creative power of the WORD is embodied by this figure, who speaks the word of creation, OM, in Tibetan script. The sweeping shape of the dress pattern piece with stitched lines coming from the figure's (other) mouth represent the sounds being put forth into the world, and reinforce the idea of something being made, or created. The bird in symbolist art has long been seen as a messenger, due to its ability to fly to realms beyond our reach; the map within its body implies access to all parts of the world.
Effort is always for our sake, not others. The business world is not all too interested in what we did to get what we done, done, but instead what we did to be successful! If what we do is not success, meaning their success, then we failed! Period! Our superiors may hate us young men and women out there correcting them, cause they might be thinking we know nothing about their success, we know nothing about the “business world” and lastly, most importantly, we just want to take their success and make people believe it’s our success. Honest and passionate people do not work this way, I don’t work this way. I work for one goal, to succeed. Success can be defined in many ways, but I have one way to define it, success is not giving up.

Yeah yeah, we, especially me (I still think Amy is just going to the convention to make me happy - and to relax in a plush hotel room), are big time nerds. To show just how big of nerds we, okay, mostly me, are - we hope to add to our Pez collection this weekend, a collection that is already at 2,142 dispensers and counting. We should break 2200 by convention's end. Yeah, nerd(s).

This year I was fortunate enough to acquire some earthworms, meant for a worm bin. I gave up on the bin fairly quickly, and just dumped all the worms into the compost pile. When it came time to screen the compost, I pulled out literally hundreds of worms and gave them to my Mother, who keeps a worm farm. The compost was beautiful! The worms helped break down the pile much faster, and I will be adding them every spring from now on. But if you don't have access to earthworms, don't worry! If your pile is on the ground, the worms will find it, and work their magic on it without your help. Adding worms yourself just makes the process happen a little faster!
Supposing that during a national emergency and while the Legislature is in session, the legislators woke up one morning to find that there was extreme scarcity of imported food, fuel, building materials, equipment required in agriculture and industry, etc., because of a monopoly, hoarding, injurious speculation, manipulation, private controls and profiteering, or that there were wide-spread lockouts and strikes paralyzing transportation, commerce and industry, or rampant espionage or sabotage endangering the very life and security of the nation. How much time would it take the legislature to enact the necessary legislation in order to cope with the situation and pass the necessary emergency measures?

AB: Rumors are always swirling around everything, specifically in sports. The NHL is not currently looking to expand, nor do I think they will look to do so in the upcoming decade. The only professional sports league that has more than 30 teams is the NFL, and any league is nuts if they believe they can compete with Roger Goodell. Contraction, however, is a different issue. Do I think that the league has 30 financially healthy teams? No. But is it really helpful to contract teams? I’m not too sure about that, but it surely doesn’t look good public relations-wise if the league shuts down franchises that it granted just a couple decades ago. No sports league has an even playing field when it comes to money, because every franchise is run differently and various markets respond differently to everything. The NHL needs to find a way to get a more even keel for all 30 teams. You’re never going to prevent the Montreals or the New Yorks or the Philadelphias or Torontos from dominating the market financially. But there are ways to balance the playing field immensely and make sure that the Floridas, Tampa Bays, Dallases, and Phoenixes are able to fairly compete.

After you have been relieved of your debt, start setting some savings goals. Figure out what it is you’re saving for, how much money you will need, and about how long it will take you to get to that goal in order to achieve it. When figuring out how much you will need to save, it would be best to save the same amount each period. This time frame of saving must be realistic, or else you will just get discouraged and it will push you further and further from your goal.

But no movement can survive a compromise of principle.

THE WORLD BESTOWS ITS BIG PRIZES, both in money and honors, for but one thing, and that is Initiative. What is Initiative? I'll tell you. It is doing the right thing without being told. But next to doing the thing without being told is to do it when you are told once. That is to say, carry the Message to Garcia: those who can carry a message get high honors, but their pay is not always in proportion. Next there are those who never do a thing until they are told twice: such get no honors and small pay. Next, there are those who do the right thing only when Necessity kicks them from behind, and these get indifference instead of honors, and a pittance for pay. This kind spends most of its time polishing a bench with a hard luck story. Then, still lower down in the scale than this, we have the fellow who will not do the right thing even when someone goes along to show him how and stays to see that he does it: he is always out of a job, and receives the contempt he deserves, unless he happens to have a rich Pa, in which case Destiny patiently awaits around the corner with a stuffed club.

I made my way to Archibald House and I was blown away by the beauty of the building, especially the wooden doors, it certainly reminded me of a gothic victorian house and the inside wow the inside was just as beautiful.

Surprisingly, I spent roughly 15-20mins with the guys, and the interview itself I feel went well, so I just have to wait until Easter has gone, and I can hopefully go back to Birmingham to do some work with Doctors, or any other programmes produced by BBC Birmingham.

This week, the challenge is to create a card with a spring theme. I really wanted to get my new Tin Man image (part of the brand new Wizard of Oz inspired collection) inky, so I opted to go with some gorgeous Evangline paper by Cosmo Cricket (it's springy, right?). I hand stitched the two pieces together to form the background panel (the grey piece at the top, and the striped below). Then I put a long strip of the bold flower pattern on - it reminds me of the scene where they all fall asleep in the field of flowers!

The presumption that Tory’s husband Donald is dead irks her mother, Mrs Head. “She dreaded the thought of her daughter becoming a widow – it was a role she cherished for herself alone.” Good news then, when a long-delayed letter from Donald arrives: he has been captured and is being held as a prisoner of war. Mrs Head is pleased – “dead he was rather a disgrace, but captured – that meant there might still be a chance for her family to distinguish itself in the war effort” – and so is Tory, until she gets to the end of his letter (which I reveal here only because the book’s blurb outlines it generally):
Place: Earth is our sacred mother. Each being has intrinsic value and its rightful place within an interconnected whole.

If an applicant presents unusually long documents, foreign-language documents, or a large number of documents, the proposed amended rules require that in appropriate cases applicants must provide additional disclosure, such as an identification of a portion of a document that caused it to be cited, and an explanation of how the specific feature, showing, or teaching of the document correlates with language in one or more claims. In those rare instances, where the specific feature, showing, or teaching cannot be correlated to a claim limitation, correlation to a specific portion of the supporting specification would be required.

Some unschoolers do have tons of friends. And there’s nothing wrong with that. Some unschoolers are quite happy with only a few friends. There’s nothing wrong with that, either. Different people are happy with different amounts of social stimulation, and more or less downtime. One of the many benefits of unschooling is a persons ability to choose how much time they want to spend out home or out-and-about; with family, or friends, or by themselves. And an individual’s ease with others, how well they naturally deal with people, is not at all dependent on whether they go to school or not. Neither is having more difficulty with people a horrible mark against you (or, should I say, it shouldn’t be). Social skills are just yet another skill that takes more work for some than others, like cooking or algebra or mechanics. I’m very fed up with hearing people talk about “social awkwardness” as if it’s the eighth deadly sin. Unschooling gives people the space to be who they are, and gain the skills needed to function in the world at their own pace and in the ways that make them the most comfortable.

Thanks for listening to them. I like making acoustic songs, and might make more soon, but it's more of a thing I do when I'm just sitting in my basement. I normally just make them when friends ask to do a split, or a song for a compilation. When those acoustic jams came out a long time ago, I never released them. Some how people got the songs, but that's cool.

Still, a sweep of the spring auction results reveals fresh clues about which artists collectors feel more, or less, confident in now. "Before the crisis, people were buying everything," says David Nahmad, a modern-art dealer with galleries in New York and London. "Now, they're more selective."

Back in the early 90s, media buyers (those who negotiate rates and arrange a schedule with national networks and local broadcast affiliates) would write up the schedules on paper forms. In a large agency with 10-15 buyers, these schedules would quickly become stacks of paper.

But do not forget that you do business in an economic environment, so win the local economy for your goals and integrate it in your strategies to promote your destination as a whole.
The next one requires some unpacking. Irene Bordoni was a stage performer, a protégé of Cole Porter, and her divorce battle of 1929 was big news in the gossip columns. Hatlo seems to be taking her to task for playing sluts (basically) on stage while unconvincingly acting innocent in the court room. He also implies that her husband is a sugar daddy and a cuckolded fool:
The 60 day challenge includes 4 classes per week. We were approached by many women who wanted to do the challenge but could not attend 4 classes per week. Therefore we decided to launch the Skinny Jean Challenge which is identical to the 60 day challenge however it is includes 2 classes per week instead of 4. I am so happy to be able to teach these women how to take control of their life, their eating habits and cycles of good days and bad days and to show them how to have the body they want while enjoying the foods they love.

I have said it before and will keep saying it: Austinites, by and large, have no sense of their own history. We’d rather pave a parking lot than preserve an old building, and we’d rather build a generic limestone- and concrete-veneer strip center most of all. We’d rather look like every other city in the Sunbelt than a place with a colorful and unique history. We mistake “newness” for “progress.” But all America is going this way. Since we no longer have any roots or sense of place, for some reason we demand that every city we live in look the same. That is wrong, and worse, that is boring.

No, no no no no - I'm going to hold in my urge to hunt down and lash out until I can wrap my head (and yours) around the "how"s and "why"s of Cool World, and explain how this could have possibly passed muster for a man who should have known better.
It wasn't all work though and there was still some time to play with 2 year old Evie and get to know 8 week old Liam, as well as chat to Russ and Shannon. At last almost everything was packed, and sadly, the family departed - excited at the prospect of being in the first home of their own, but also aware of all the work ahead of them. We are very much looking forward to our first visit in early May. I am assured there will be plenty of gardening to do (don't mind if it is only weeding), and lots of cuddle time with the grandchildren.

Also, it's easier on us to ride them because of this reason. Those big heavy thick spines that horses (and similar animals) have don't have a lot of flexibility. When you look at a horse running, the spines stays relatively level and straight. That makes for a much smoother and comfier ride for the passenger.

I cannot romanticize my own younger years nearly hard enough to forget that. Maybe some people can, and anybody can talk a good long line about all of the things Dynasty’s mom could have done beyond getting the school board and an independent panel to review the situation, but it seems like everything on that list amounts to a polite request for justice.

Meanwhile we had moved to help lower our expenses, into a duplex. A wonderful family, the Buxcel's, had helped us move. They were a family on the road at the time. They were in the Reno area for a month or so and we went and met up with them a few times. I picked at their brain a lot about living on the road and we checked out their bus. It made me desire it even more!
The next event is the first in the Brewniversity Back-To-School program. On July 16th at Deckard's American Tavern, we are going to give you a stiff drink of learnin' with the first annual Whiskey Class. You will get to taste five different whiskeys from 4 different countries. All top-shelf stuff and up. No cheap hooch here! Now since I know that you are beer drinkers, I am going to pair a different beer to compliment each whiskey. You are going to need something to sip on while you are getting educated, and we can't give you that much hard liquor. I've heard about you and hard liquor....Expect lighter bodied beers with lighter whiskey, rye ale with rye whiskey, etc. On hand will be Kevin Mulcahy, an expert on all things related to whiskey. This guy is incredibly knowledgeable and entertaining, so come with questions and be prepared to learn something. This event, like the cheese one, runs from 3:00 to 5:00 pm, and the cost is only $25.00. Chef Deckard is also going to have an affordable, whiskey-themed food special that evening if you want to stick around for dinner. We did this type of event last year as well, but with tequila, and it was a huge success. Frankly, I don't actually have a good reason why it has taken so long to do another one.

The nation’s largest banks have turned more in profit in the last 30 months than they did in nearly eight years preceding the crisis, all while spending millions to derail significant reform legislation. And since the Dodd-Frank Act became law, they have spent millions more to weaken its rules and prevent certain regulations from taking effect. Bank lobbying, in fact, is now on pace to reach a record high this year.

So I've been doing my horror movie homework lately: the first two Friday the 13th movies and the first Nightmare on Elm Street. I'd've hit up the Halloween series, too, but the first movie is gone from Netflix insty and H2O sequel is...quite, quite dreadful. I watched it out of desperation on cable once when I was sick. Even my massive childhood crush on Jamie Lee Curtis couldn't make it good; it only made it watchable.

The energy outside the Chicago Theatre was CRAZY! The fans were beyond ready. Once we were allowed inside, I made a beeline to purchase a program and tee shirt. I was escorted to my seat by a friendly upbeat usher who told me I was in for quite a show. My seat was on the main floor in perfect view of the stage, I got settled, chatted with some people nearby; saw a few friends, and spent time texting and checking Twitter. Mindless Behavior, a tween group took to the stage. They were good but definitely not for my demographic. I was eager (very) for them to get through their set. They were cute and energetic but I can only take so much auto-tune.
This week has been busy. Remember that story I started that was supposed to be the next short short in the City of Free Reads section on this blog? Well, it is now a short novel and I finished it yesterday. I wrote the ending on the first full draft that is. Now I have to edit and design a cover, and come up with a new title. The old tentative title no longer fits the story. I like this story and I love how it just took off and really flourished into what it is now.
I had to pivot completely by cutting our print publication and redeveloping our online presence along with our media kit and editorial and sales systems.

My son (the picky one) brought this chicken recipe home during his December break. It was his new favorite and he wanted me to make it. I obliged. It is now a favorite of the whole family. We liked it so much that I made a couple of big batches of the spice mix to have around since we'll be eating so much of it! A friend made it for Curtis at school, but they got it from C. Perez, as it was posted on Allrecipes.com. I made a couple of changes, such as adding honey to the sauce to balance the acidity, and slicing the chicken breast halves in half so they are not so thick, and therefore cook through easier. I will give you the recipe as I've tweaked it. For the record, Curtis likes it done with the thick chicken breasts, and I suggest if you choose to keep the breast intact like that, that after browning them on each side, finish them for 10 minutes in a 400 degree oven, so they cook all the way through.

Recently Microsoft Windows asked if I wanted to try out their new Nokia Lumia 900 Windows Phone (which just got a rave review from the New York Times). As someone who had a half-broken flip phone (seriously) until a few months ago, I'm still geeking out on how I can read blogs while sitting in the back of a taxi. The Nokia Lumia 900 is supposed to be the best phone for social media, so I really wanted to try it out. As you know, I very, very rarely do sponsored posts, but I thought this would be awesome. So, to try it out, I challenged the phone to help Toby and me put together this little food guide...

One can almost set a clock by the habits of field mice. Last week my van had telltale signs of mouse invasion. Bits of insulation covered the passenger side floor and I knew that it was time to open the glove box, remove the cabin air filter, and clean out the messy remnants of the evening. Out also came the mousetraps, one set on the battery under the hood, and the other placed on the passenger side floor.

I have received a significant amount of feedback from family members and others that have encouraged me to keep writing, both for my own catharsis and because the raw honesty of my writing has helped some. I never hoped that I would reach the point where I was asked to keep writing, but I am flattered that I have.

a) Psychology
I bring this up because, now that I am writing almost daily, I have become hyper aware of writing by other author's. I read a variety of books, including many children's novels (see, there, I said novels instead of saying books again). I keep noticing that words show up twice in many paragraphs. They show up twice in many sentences even. It is almost painful to my ears to hear such, but since I am seeing it in some of the best authors (all sorts of examples in Harry Potter), perhaps this isn't a general rule of writing. For some reason, I thought it was.
William DeVaughn: Blood Is Thicker Than Water
Fields became a “Tramp Juggler” at some risk. Many such characters already existed, such as Nat Willis, The “Happy Tramp” and tramp juggler James Harrigan. His make-up was grotesque and clownish in the early years. By 1898 he was billed as W.C. Fields. In that year he married Hattie Hughes, a chorus girl who became his stage assistant. In 1899 he made his debut at Miner’s Bowery Theatre. He then embarked on a tour with Irwin’s Burlesquers. At this stage he was already getting great reviews. He had tons of amazing patter from the first, delivered in a voice not unlike the one we know from films and radio. He not only a really good juggler but really funny, and this helped put him over with audiences and with bookers.

It’s an all-too-common trap to fall into. We make our spirituality an abstract concept with no bearing on our conduct in the real-world.

But Twilight’s magical talent is for naught when it does nothing for the honor of her friends and her town. Trixie’s reign is ushered in by Twilight’s own fear.
It was nearly 2pm and the crowd was waiting patiently along Jalan Tun Perak, as we could not move forward. Shouts of “Bersih” and “Bangun Rakyat” could be heard as well as renditions of “Negara Ku”. I was at the Masjid Jamek station when I heard a popping sound and realised that tear gas canisters had been fired. Chaos ensued. The crowd was not aware that Ambiga had given instructions for the rally to disperse as we were far away and as such, the actions of the police caught everyone by surprise!

Admittedly these are just two examples. And the awards can’t be all things to all people, nor should it be. But its flailing about for relevance betrays its roots in the monoculture.

Now, again, I’m all about giving grace to people, but there comes a point when it crosses into foolishness. We try to write in more rules and more regulations to deal with the problem, but we’re really only writing our way around the problem and never actually dealing with it. We only complicate the problem by making more laws that essentially say the same thing.
Secondly, entrance to the tour is in timed slots and the studio has very sensibly limited the amount of people who can enter the tour at any one time (and I hope they continue to do this in the future as I believe it is the key to its success). This means that although there are several people looking at the same exhibits as you, there aren’t huge queues, (even the queue for the broomstick and flying car green screen photographs wasn’t as bad as queuing to get into Ollivander’s Wand Shop in Florida (and didn’t involve standing in blazing sunshine for over an hour) or so many people milling around that you can’t see or photograph the exhibits properly, as was also the case in
The Meiji period (1868-1912) was a period of dynamic intercultural exchange and economic expansion in Japan, which is clearly reflected in Yoshitoshi's work. Depictions of steam locomotives and European dress show a new cultural landscape, and his compositions bristle with hyper energy, distinctive shading and perspective. Other subjects include demons, ghosts, warriors, supernatural animals, popular Kabuki actors and well-known beauties, which have contributed to his ongoing popularity.

For the border, police and military are being told t expect great civil unrest when the U.S. dollar collapses, since the peso’s worth is based on the dollar. A new financial system and re-evaluation of the dollar is expected to take 1-2 weeks to go into effect after the mass arrests and restructuring of financial and political infrastructure occurs. The border closure is expected to last at least 72 hours but no longer than one week.
The beauty of these portfolios is that they are all made using a single piece of latigo leather and are secured with two hand-hammered copper rivets, thus no glue or stitches were used. Each portfolio is cut, burnished, folded, stamped, riveted and oiled, one at a time, entirely by hand and built in-house in L.A.. Given that they are made from premium leather, the leather will soften over time and continuous use will give it a nice patina. They are available in various sizes, though the standard size, priced at about $150, is designed to fit a stack of letter-size paper. Other sizes include an extra large portfolio that can fit a 17″ MacBook pro, a smaller iPad-size folio and a small folio that’ll fit a book. You can also contact the designer directly for a custom order.

Something that is really causing much alarm is the fact that people don't want to send their kids for music lessons any more. They all have various reasons: No time, or it's a waste of time, too expensive, the kids have too many extra mural activites, too much homework, no time to practise....I can write down at least ten more excuses, 'cause that's what they are. Lame excuses. I do realize that in some cases it's true and I can understand that not all want to learn an instrument. The losers are the children and their children, for the value of playing a musical instrument is greatly under-estimated!

When all had become silent in the house, he crept outside, and to a nearby well. He filled a jar with water and, after removing his robe, poured the water over himself. He did this several times more. When he re-entered the house, and his bed, he slept soundly………

The more I saw this cover the more I actually started to like it. I love how we still have the city in the background and reflected at the bottom so it shows the dystopian theme of the book and I really love that you have Tris on there looking back at the city.

Yes the Dutch Clover is really starting to pop out here now. It has been up and blooming in some spots for a week or more but the new nectar producing blooms are finally pushing through in enough numbers to get the working girl's attention.
This is why I blog.
In Tower Hamlets (one of the poorest areas in the UK), the charity Shelter calculates that the annual earnings a tenant needs to make renting a flat affordable are £67,669. It’s a figure I find difficult to read out loud without lisping, let alone conceive of earning myself. It’s not achievable – in fact, it makes me feel like I’m going a bit mad. And it highlights the ever-lurking threat of homelessness – that slow slide over a year from being made redundant, to being priced out of your shared flat, to carrying your rucksack between friends’ futons, and then, after a clipped conversation in their little blue kitchen, sitting on a bench at dawn with nowhere to go.

This is a film that proves how well movies can adapt books. It helps that Murakami worked on the script but Miike uses all of the techniques open to film-makers to actually craft a film much more subtle than the source novel and able to affect viewers in a variety of way.
The first thing was the election of Ratzinger as Pope. I don't recognized Ratzinger as the Pope, even though he is. So since he has sat on the throne of St. Peter, I am technically not in communion with the church, and therefore I haven't taken communion at services.

Since the Pacific Grove lighthouse is near 17 mile drive (gorgeous dive if you've never been there) and the Pebble Beach Golf Course, I decided to add Mark's Finest Papers, a Heinrich Company's set called New Pines to add some dimension and give the whole framed image a "woodland" feel to it. Here's a close up so you can see all of the dimension inside the frame.
One man came on the bus and he looked at the seat beside me. He bowed as greeting to me, so I did it back to him. We didn’t speak anything to each other. I thought he looked like to one of my friends.
As the sidepods are so slim and there being no low level exhausts, there is a wide expanse of exposed floor. The diffuser sweeps outwards and there is a generous cut out around the rear wheels. The centre section of the diffuser often termed the boat tail is exposed to the airflow. Suggesting the rear impact structure is raised clear fo the floor. This is in contrast to Red Bulls preferred practice of a low rear crash structure. The lowered section probably allows airflow over the floor to pass through the starter motor hole to aid airflow passing up under the diffuser.

As a non-traditional college student—or 25-year plan-ee—I used to think I possessed the viewpoint of a learned veteran of life. At least the first 40 odd years of said life. Instead, it turns out that even though I’m old enough to be addressed as “Mom” by the majority of my peers (and several of my professors!) on campus, I learned I will forever be adding to my inventory of life experience. Because fortunately for me, it is possible to teach an old dog new tricks.
Nintendo gamers have much to look forward to in the coming months. While 2011 was almost completely barren for Nintendo’s home console, 2012 has promise. In one month, E3 2012 will officially kick off. Most gamers would testify that this marks the most exciting period of the year, flourishing with news and video footage of the most anticipated titles. Microsoft will impress the audience with Master Chief’s return in Halo 4. Sony has already announced a slew of first-party titles, such as Playstation All-Stars Battle Royale and The Last of Us, in addition to several surprises for the early Vita adopters. Some of these deserve an article all to themselves, but the show-stopper this year will certainly be the Nintendo Wii U.
Insurgent starts where Divergent left off, with Tris riding a train to Amity headquarters with adrenaline pumping through her. This was a little hard for me to like at first, because I forgot a lot of what had happened in Divergent and there wasn't any real back story. But thankfully I went to Down The Rabbit Hole's Happily Ever Endings page and read what happened in Divergent. So thank you, Happily Ever Endings team! With the story fresh in my mind I was able to sit down and simply enjoy the ride!
A closed door swings open...and Wynne Fischer enters an elegant bondage club for those who crave extremes of forbidden sensation. Within the walls of Twilight, ultramale temptation comes in threes: the muscular brothers Rolf and Dierk, and the mysterious Master Zane. Dominance is in their blood and the natural submissiveness of the inexperienced Wynne arouses the men beyond belief. Baring herself body and soul at their command, their captive is about to satisfy her most hidden desires as she explores the dark side of sexual passion...

Last weekend, we visited the mall that was the last place I visited before the hospital. The nurse had called and told me our room was ready, hours ahead of schedule, and I panicked, asking for just a few more hours. I needed to find something for her to wear. A completely ridiculous task, in retrospect, since she never wore the little yellow dress we bought for her. They don't make dresses for babies that small, for babies who don't live. But still, I had to buy her something, for whatever reason.
I love noodles. Love. I believe food tastes better with certain moods and certain weather. Food is like wine and to maximize enjoyment food should be paired to season and mood. Nothing beats noodle soup on a cold day whose air is heavy with un-fallen rain. And if I happen to have had a wee too much to drink the night before the salty broth of noodle soup is a tonic.

I want to thank Adele for letting me be a guest blogger on her fantastic blog! I love her blog and all of her great ideas. My name is Jullee and I blog over at The Grubery. I am the Mom to two amazing little girls age 4 and 18 months, and I am learning to cook amazing meals one dish at a time. Before my oldest was born my husband and I ate out constantly. Then when my first daughter came we started eating out less and I started to cook a bit. When my youngest came along I decided that it was time to get the cooking show on the road. I am truly learning to love cooking a delicious meal for my family. I have become much more daring and sure of myself in the kitchen.

There’s no business like show business. Everything about it is appealing. And of course, nowhere can you get that happy feeling.
So, I’m not entirely sure where this recipe originated. I was given it by my mother in law, who was given it by a co-worker who got it from someone (I think it was originally one of The Pioneer Woman’s recipes). Wherever it came from (and if someone can affirm or deny the origins, please let me know) it is delicious, and a great slap-together dessert when you’ve got a sweet tooth.
When I worked on the newsdesk at The Independent I dealt with dozens of reports every day. It's difficult to pick out individual stories, nearly twenty years later. The murder of Stephen Lawrence is an exception.
This past weekend was my first Saturday in many weeks that I did not have to get up early for class. Although it was great to be able to sleep in and enjoy the feeling of being lazy on a Saturday morning, I felt as though I was missing something. Yes, I miss the fun and my new friends of my public speaking class.
Monday, I came into my office and my hair immediately stood on end. It was even colder than it was the week before. The thermostat was on 55! 55! That's crazy! I immediately panicked and ran over to the fish bowl and sure enough...Platelet was dead. He FROZE to death! Poor little fishy. I'm getting a little misty just typing about it.
I do like it used on the lips but it doesn't last as well as a lipstick, it's too dry because it isn't waxy . So I suggest using it with a touch of balm over the top. There is nothing as satisfying as getting an exact match between lip and cheek colour so it is worth pursuing (these small things make me happy).

Bennett tried to stop him as he went by, and when Linden didn’t even turn his head at the sound of his name, he glared at the now-silent students for several seconds. They all watched Linden’s retreat, some of them looking upset, and others just puzzled. But the chatter was already starting back up as Bennett reached their table and stood over Katie.
Personally, I'd be very uncomfortable sitting in a restaurant that was being disassembled around me! I'd feel like I was in the way and out of place, like I didn't belong and needed to get out.

This is but a taster of the complete guide that comes with the latest edition of my book, 'A Town Like Paris'.
The seller is a development company whose loans have been transferred to NAMA, Shieldpoint 22 Limited controlled by developers Eugene Larkin and John Flynn and the property has been on the market reportedly for more than a year. It is understood that NAMA paid just GBP 18m (€21.2m) for the AIB loan on the property, meaning that NAMA should be able to book a profit of some €8m on the transaction, which will be just over 1% of its projected operating profit – that is, profit before impairments – of €600m in 2011. The buyer is not known at this stage, nor is the face value of the loans but it is believed it is over GBP 25m, with the site being originally purchased for GBP 40m in the mid-2000s which indicates an eye-watering loss of nearly 40% for the developers.

Yet there is something distinctly modern, and even cinematic, about Yuka's approach to production and presentation. Her designs mix sexuality with innocence, recalling early collections by Tao for Comme des Garcons, while the dark undertones of the narrative that holds the collection together reminded me of a Haruki Murakami novel.

There wasn’t one. A) I feel no need to console such a trivial woman. B) Pretty sure I emailed her three hours earlier telling her we would gladly reduce her rent increase by over half to accommodate her. Clearly that was unappreciated and unnoticed given that there was no mention of it anywhere in her ranting email.

You should know that I’ve learned everything I ever want to know about the streets from The First 48, and a few colorful characters I’ve encountered on life’s journey. The cats who get caught up in shemminy sham in the show’s featured cities are but a sampling of the derelicts that probably lurk in the nooks and crannies of all cities. And it seems the constant is this: it never occurs to said derelicts that the principles to which they adhere, and the loyalties they display are probably the reason the popos showed up at their mama’s door in the first place.

She even sang songs that acknowledged her weight, such as “Nobody Loves a Fat Girl, But Oh How a Fat Girl Can Love”.

After completing my walk for the day, I am rethinking going kayaking tomorrow, it was a bit on the cool side, and Ludington will be even cooler yet since it is so much farther north, and on Lake Michigan. If I’m going to drive that far, I want it to be as close to perfect as I can get. Besides, there is more wildlife here at my apartment complex than I can handle anyway. I took 277 photos today, a lot of them bad, some are for the weekly challenge, and there will be at least a few posted here. Not only did I have to sort through all of them, I had to do some bird identification to make sure I saw what I thought I saw. Yup, one of those kinds of days. Oh, and I only did one lap, plus hung out in the new swamp for a while.
And like the finest drills, it finally broke.
- In January the Party launched Operation Fightback in response to regular abuses of our democratic fights by the media and political establishment. A large number of politically correct outrages have been reversed, cultural parades have been reinstated, persecution at the hands of local authorities has been dealt with and reversed, newspapers have scrapped, withdrawn or retracted smear stories and anti-BNP celebrities and other public figures have been held to account for their incitements. Operation Fightback is to be expanded after the Euro Elections to cope with the increased number of attacks on the Party.
Angry shouts of agreement started.
“ Her inspection of the bedroom finished, she walked down the staircase into the coolness of the stone-flagged hallway. A large collection of sun-hats hung on pegs in the entrance hall, bowls were filled with dried lavender and a huge pottery jar was crammed with walking-sticks, some of which had ornate silver handles. By the time she reached the front door of the house, she knew, it had to be hers for the summer. If it had a secret she would do her best to discover it and she was not going to miss the trail across the Mountains of the Moon to what was undoubtedly the greatest small picture in the world.”

There have been a number of times when I’ve been sitting in traffic & seen this sticker on a car. The underlying thought is obvious enough – a real life is spent accumulating stuff. It doesn’t matter that the toys are I suppose, as long as they’re the latest, smallest, fastest…
My dear and precious husband was in England for a conference at the beginning of December and sweet cherub that he is, went to a yarn shop and bought me some yarn! Now, until recently, the said cherub, still referred to my knitting as "sewing" ...proudly telling people that I am "...really good at sewing..."...so you'll understand that he has no concept about what yarns are and which brands / blends are desirable, never mind color and quantity ...

So lately there have been a lot of posts about blogging fatigue, twitter promotion overload (here and here), and the state of blogging in general. Also, many bloggers seem to have hit the overwhelmed point and are either thinking of stopping altogether or doing some major readjusting. And as I read through these posts, I often found myself nodding my head because I share many of the sentiments.

Emma’s real problems only became apparent after she received the MMR vaccination at 13 months. Up until this age Emma had been developing normally, she was beginning to walk, talk, was alert and was reaching all her developmental milestones. After the MMR however, Emma became very sick indeed after an extremely bad reaction. By this time Ms X was beginning to connect the dots and was waking up to the realization that it was the vaccinations that were causing her daughters problems. Sadly it was too late for little Emma. The damage was done.
What it comes down to for me is all-embracing amusement and replayability. What acceptable is a fifty hour bold if a lot of of it is the aloft old affair for thirty of them?

Still, I’ve come to think that the most important force driving all these something-for-nothing fantasies is a subtler and more pervasive thing: the faith in progress that is the established but unmentionable religion of the modern industrial world. The belief in perpetual progress embodies exactly the same kind of grand narrative as speculative bubbles and apocalyptic prophecies: such everyday realities as diminishing returns and limits to growth are brushed aside by the conviction that the future must, by some irrevocable law of existence, always be shinier than the past. That’s what motivates the people who pop up on this and every other peak oil-related blog to insist that we can keep on powering our SUVs and Blackberries forever by building thorium reactors or harnessing zero point energy or turning the state of Nevada into one vast algae farm. It’s not incidental, either, that the vast majority of these people aren’t actually doing anything to make these dayreams happen; as with the rest of the something-for-nothing fantasies, reasons to do nothing have an important role in the payoff.

As a teenager, I read an article in Psychology Today about the importance of creativity and imagination. Studies show that people who are realists have trouble coping when suffering comes into their lives. They fall apart. But imaginative people can enter their fantasy world when things go badly, and they are not as susceptible to total breakdowns. I believe this is one of the reasons that I have been so resilient.

As I've noted elsewhere, Reichert also pushes Calvin's date of birth forward from 1982 to 2009. She pretty much had to do this, because if she had stuck to Asimov's original timeline, she would have wound up writing an alternate history novel set in an alternate 2008, rather than a science fiction novel set in the future.

Gov. Bill Ritter of Colorado signed into law an outrageous bill that, in the name of providing “equality” for homosexuals and transgenders, that actually allows men to use women’s restrooms—right alongside women and little girls. The new law starts with civil penalties of up to $5,000 for any business whose beliefs and practices run contrary to the promotion of homosexuals, bisexuals, transgenders . . . or anyone who is perceived as such. But then it goes a step further by threatening criminal penalties of up to a year in prison. This frightening aspect makes one ask: If the privacy of innocent children isn’t enough to derail the homosexual activists’ agenda, what is?

I really don't know where to start. I cannot believe how much happened in this novel. I would be reading at later points in the book, and realise what Katniss was talking about happened earlier in Mockingjay, not in another book. Seriously, so much goes on, and it spans quite a period of time, I'm amazed it all fit in one book. And as you would hope for the finale in such a spectacular series, there is action and suspense like you wouldn't believe! And there is no way I can really talk about any of it without spoiling the story, because it starts right from the beginning.

See, in Jesus’ sufferings He was seeking us. And when we suffer, Jesus is telling us to seek Him. Seek Him, be in fellowship like Him; pray like Him, obey like Him and know that Christ has born our iniquities for us. He lost His glory, His place in heaven and was forsaken by His Father to suffer and endure for us so that we might have glory, a place in heaven and the affirmation of God the Father.

I wanted to get new tables for my basement, but I knew I wanted them to be funky and like nothing anyone else has. I was at DI, and found two of these for $10! $5 each!!! I still needed tops for them, and again, I was at DI, and found the glass tops on another table for $10 each. I painted them from a weird dingy cream to a chartreuse yellowy-green. I LOVE THEM! I say, "them." I haven't brought the other table in yet, as I don't know what I am going to put on it. It is still clogging up the garage.

So I took my gorgeous Picture Polish Jade, made some cute green tips and then with my black striper, some pink and white polish and some dotters I got down to business and did some Cherry Blossom Nail Art. I like it and think it's cute - basic but effective!
“Other units are watching the highway and exits for the Cadillac and the bus. I’m sorry about waking up the child, but it’s necessary.”

In fact, Dogu-chan, is in many ways a direct spoof of "Cutie Honey."
The name of the dish refers to the beautiful veil-like quality of the bamboo pith, somewhat see through where you can sort of make out what's inside but you can't see it clearly, you just sort of see a shadow of it. The name is supposed to poetically evoke the shadow of a beautiful woman glimpsed through a veil or thin curtain - in a romantic, not creepy way - get your dirty minds out of the gutter.
The Underworld Trilogy has been a perfect example of popcorn entertainment ever since its inception. After sitting through each of the movie I felt that One more movie and they would over do the franchise but every time I was proved wrong owing to some exhilarating action sequences and acceptable storyline. Even the performances kept getting better and better with time. So when I heard of this fourth installment I had mixed feelings about it. Half of my heart felt it would be another belter but the rest of it said that this could just be that installment where they go the full Monty. The biggest suspense now for me was to see which half was right.

On a sad note, I learned this weekend that the player who ran Adthar and then Olaf is pulling out of the group. He's nearly 14 now and academic pressures are mounting so there just wasn't enough time for him to give a full Saturday to the group. We wished him well and I offered any materials or support he needed if he was interested in setting up a gaming group amongst his contemporaries.
“Why were you talking to that cop?” the attacker asked in a harsh voice.
We're hard at work on some really exciting projects and can't wait to finish them up so we can ship them off to the printers.
...But back to this Tova girlfriend of his. She will look and smell like a flower child, braids in her hair, leather sandals on her aforementioned biggish feet, she will wear some kind of woven hippie purse. Eau de Patchouli will waft from her unshaven armpits. But her peacenik look will confuse me, because she will actually HATE PEACE. She will do things like call Palestinians "animals." She will be loudly thankful for the support the US gives Israel, which allows the Jewish State to amass one hell of a motherfucking Defense Force.
After spending a good chunk of time in the church we went into town for our shopping, enjoying cones of hot chips to warm our cold fingers, before getting the bus back home. Once home and warmed up we finished our pudding mix, which is now resting ready for steaming tomorrow:
I was reintroduced to The Boss at other moments while growing up, and fortunately got better, more thoughtful exposure, at the hands of Jim and Laura, my parents’ closest friends, who followed his tours all over the U.S.
If the data which THEMIS and SOHO are now contemplating becomes crystallized – if the beauty seen in a crop circle last summer becomes a reality: if we have a CME or a particle storm equal to or more powerful than that single event of last July 7th, Earth is in for a rocky ride.

Today my son lost his job. I've been trying to wrap my head around that all day. I wish that I could take away any pain in his life. He's had enough already, losing his sister. But he's 24 years old, and things happen. This is through no fault of his own, but the laws being what they are, who knows if he'll get unemployment. I know the people he's been working for, and there is truly no way to please them. So life goes on, that much we know, those of us who have been around the block a time or three.
Also they don't have pics of their paper/card colours on their website, so you don't really know what colours you are going to get delivered to you or what weights they will be etc. Last time I just asked for assorted colours (I bought 2 boxes of white and 2 coloured to make up for the postage lol), but most of it was colours that I would never use and I ended up giving them to the kids to draw on.

I like to dice these ends up and fry them with onions and garlic, the beginnings of either a hearty chowder or in this case a delicious pasta dish. I'll swap out lean prosciutto, whenever these bacon ends are unavailable.
It’s really important to me to make sure the voice behind the novels is authentic – teens seem to be able to smell when an author doesn’t believe in their characters and I wouldn’t want to disappoint them. Besides, that lippy teenager isn’t so far away – she’s still part of me.
I did my research on different places in the city that have a note worthy egg cream. I also made sure I knew what I was getting. You see, ask for a New York egg cream and you get a different drink from a Brooklyn egg cream. New York is vanilla flavored and Brooklyn is chocolate flavored. There is a Bronx egg cream, strawberry, and I've heard of a San Fransisco egg cream, which is hazelnut.
Oh boy, totally scaring me now. Is it true though -- did they really say the transition from 8th to 9th grade is the third most traumatic experience for them?

But they came. They dragged theirselves out of bed, and they combed their hairs and warmed their cars, and they mucked on over, today, to fix up our Soldier Babies.
Interestingly, the women all caught my sense of humor in that same response and laughed. He did not. Guys......
It is somehow so refreshing to be at last in a relationship with a man who is so relaxed in his own skin and who makes me feel safe and secure. I have realized today in retrospect that all the men I was ever seriously involved with - however great they all were - never really knew what they wanted - with their own life or with me.
The vegetable garden has produced a moderate amount for us, beans were good as always, and we did get to pick some tomatoes for the first time in a few years, even without a lot of spraying. A lot of spaghetti squash, a fairly typical serve of zucchinis, some celery, a couple of eggplants and a range of other odds and ends such as cucumbers and chillis to round it out.
The science of Marxism explains not only how they think, their philosophical foundations and the materialist basis for their ideologies but shows how due to their subjectivity they remain blind to the consequences of their method. Their ideologies are invariably expressions of the radical petty bourgeoisie and the labor aristocracy which feel the crushing weight of capitalism’s collapse but seek to maintain their privileges and to avoid the coming to power of the working class and the most oppressed and marginalized peoples both here and internationally. Note the absence of anti-imperialist demands or even mention of the current spate of attacks on Gaza or the Zionist colonialist plans to build 1000 more homes in East Jerusalem.
Gregory H. Stanton is the founder (1999) and president of Genocide Watch, the founder (1981) and director of the Cambodian Genocide Project, and the founder (1999) and Chair of the International Campaign to End Genocide. From 2007 to 2009 he was the President of the International Association of Genocide Scholars.
One of them, BFM- Brasserie des Franches-Montagne, occupies 10 of the top 20 twenty ratings for Swiss beers on Ratebeer, a position resembling that of Nøgne Ø in Norway. The decent beers of the Trois Dames brewery of the nearby Vaud canton do not reach that high only because they are generally rated by too few people. Both give a successful Swiss twist to beer styles originating in Belgium and beyond.

Higgs bosons, if they exist, do not last long enough to show up directly in the subatomic debris of these collisions. Discovery relies on observing the particles into which Higgs bosons disintegrate, rather than detecting them directly. But the mass of the Higgs itself is unknown, leaving much uncertainty about the best place to look for decay particles.
A special day for our family and another perfect day in all our lives.
I don't know how many times I told Derek he could leave me, but he refused. Probably equivalent to the number of times he responded to a spectator that shouted "Looking good" with the response "Feeling good" which was equivalent to the number of times I considered punching him in the gut. Actually, I'm totally kidding. Besides my wonky hip, the rest of me was actually feeling fine. Yes, I was freezing and soaked, and that made things miserable... but other than that hip, my body was still fully functioning and I was still enjoying my time out there.

For some mid-life crisis suffering guys, adventure comes in the form of a fast sports car. The thrill of going down an open highway with the accelerator pushed to the floorboard brings back carefree teenage days when their highest priority was getting a cheerleader with big boobies into the backseat of his car. Speaking personally for myself, while at one time I did own, what was to me, a very special sports car I was far more into slowly cruising Ocean Boulevard of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina checking out the young ladies. For reasons I cannot really explain the second I went five miles over the speed limit every fat deputy sheriff and fanatical highway patrolman in Georgetown county would be on my tail flashing their blue lights. Anyone who has to pay car insurance would know speeding tickets have a way of severely cutting into a person’s spending money. Since spending money for me is a still a hard thing for me to come by, I still relish taking life slowly.

Have a wonderful holiday weekend everyone! I will see you back here on Tuesday.
The buildings abutting Teardrop Park are 23- or 24-story buildings. The ten Atlantic Yards buildings abutting the landscaped greenspace will all be substantially that height and mostly considerably taller. In descending order of currently planed height, they will be the equivalent of; 46 stories, 41 stories, 39 stories, 31 stories, 28 stories, 28 stories, 24 stories, 21 stories, 20 stories, and 18 stories. In addition, the non-abutting buildings just across the street, will add a towering presence and cast substantial shadows, especially at the end of the day. In descending order of currently planed height, they will be the equivalent of; 51 stories (previously 60), 51 stories, 32 stories, and 29 stories (previously 42), and 27 stories. (There is another 25-story building somewhat further West across another street.)
And I relocate on boughs of hope,
The European Union and the European Council plan to destroy our identity: “Cultural policy must avoid the popular distinction between ‘them’ and ‘us’, even mentioning ‘the other’ , as this opens the gate for imposing collective identity on the individual.” Yet they impose the collective identity “European” on all the diverse nations of Europe!
Hello and welcome back to Second Chance to Live my friend. I am happy to see that you decided to stop by to visit with me. Several months ago I wrote an article, Second Chance to Live — My Presence has been My Absence in which I explained why I had been in the hospital from August 17 – September 1 and unable to answer email and contribute to Second Chance to Live during that time period. My hospitalization had been a result of a sinus infection that developed into an orbital cellulitus.
When I posted about The Dead Zone, I mentioned that it was the first book to introduce the town of Castle Rock, and that all of the books that King writes about Castle Rock take place in the same “universe”. Cujo is the second book to feature Castle Rock (the main events of the story occur in Castle Rock this time, rather than just a side story). King establishes the “universe sharing” right off the bat too. The first paragraph of Cujo is actually a recap of the Castle Rock events from The Dead Zone (as in “Once upon a time there was a bad man in Castle Rock named Frank Dodd” – those aren’t the exact words, but I don’t have the book on me at the moment, but you should get the idea). The recap reminds us of Frank Dodd and gives us a rundown of all the girls he murdered. We are then reminded that Johnny Smith came to town and stopped him. We then find out that the story of Frank Dodd has stuck around and Frank has become a sort of boogeyman to the local children (as in, be a good little boy/girl or Frank Dodd will come and murder you in your sleep). Many, many times throughout the book the characters either make reference to or have remembrances about Frank Dodd.
What a wonderful treasure.
He did not advocate taking over all white businesses: “We just want a fair share. If we don’t do it (nationalisation), we will always stay poor. The Oppenheimers don’t need to worry because we only want 60% of Anglo American’s money.”

Her last words….her last breath.
For me, yes. The concepts and themes are horrific even if they are dealt with in a detached manner. Horror movies, as I've said before, are deeply personable. One person who I saw it with was not scared by it while I found myself hiding my eyes and bracing for a scare, which to me means it's working on a horror level... For instance when Dana and Marty are in the underground jail for the demons, ghosts etc I was well freaked out when Pseudo-Pinhead just stared at Dana. Eerie as fuck that was. It wasn't nearly as traumatic as The Woman In Black for me, but it worked.
Another round of surveys done, we piled into the car. Normally my Tanzanian supervisor took the window seat, punching data into his iPad, the window open to let in air, me smooshed between him and a Norwegian scientist. The professor, that veritable old gentleman, always took the front seat, and the other students and ministry employees crammed in the back. This time, however, I took the window seat. I was eager to catch pictures of the people of town, albeit surreptitiously. What I really wanted to catch was a picture of the Masai who from time-to-time walked down the street, talking into their cellphones. I wanted visual proof of the incongruity that is the Western mental picture of Africa and the reality of Tanzania.
If you phone a publishing company and ask the name of the commissioning editor for the list you are interested in, you may or may not be given it. I've been refused the email address of a commissioning editor by a telephone-answering Hitler. Even when I told her I'd already published more than 50 books of the same type, she was reluctant to give it to me. Funny way to run a business, employing staff to make it difficult for the buyers to acquire the product they sell. But then, publishing is a funny business.

The bell jingled as the door opened behind her. She glanced in the mirror, over her shoulder, where a hulking silhouette filled the shop’s doorway. There was something familiar in the set of the man’s broad shoulders, in the slow way he reached up and removed his hat.
Finally there's that weedy Brown Ale. Which is about 10º weaker than a typical Brown Ale of the 1930's. It looks more like one from the austerity years of the 1940's. It, too, is surprisingly highly attenuated.
When Occupy Wall Street set up camp in the middle of September 2011, Americans were reminded of the collective power of citizens. American history is rich with movements of the people that created change; the Boston Tea Party, the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the Occupy camps across the country, all involved citizens coming together with a common desire to participate in shaping the future of this country. The Tea Party sparked the American Revolution, the Bus Boycott lead to the fight for civil rights, and the Occupy movement has focused the national discourse on economic and social inequalities. Throughout history, change in our democracy has been achieved through community organizing and direct action.
What big change have you decided to make recently? What have you done to take the first step towards it?

The museum was an interesting place but it was very hot wandering about as nearly everything was displayed outside and the current temperature is about 36c/96F. Some of the aircraft were beautifully restored, others in a sorry state, but overall a very unique museum – especially because they have grouped together different variants of the same types of Soviet built Mikoyan Gurevich (MiG) fighter aircraft they have operated i.e. the MiG-17 “Fresco”, MiG-19 “Farmer” and MiG-21 “Fishbed” (I have never seen this before).
Usually by November we are looking at mild sunny days with the occasional day of rain and wind----but this year it has been the other way around.

The next group is an off shoot of the bicycle, and that is the motor scooter. This little idea goes back many many years especially in Europe where the streets are very narrow and the parking is also very limited. These very economical vehicles car carry large amounts of baggage with some creative thinking as well as being able to scoot you down the road at 40 mph. This is my personal mode of transportation for my 10 mile round trip to work on Wednesday thru Sunday at the Rum Bar. I spend approximately $5.00 a week on gasoline and I get to ride with the breezes in my face and the cool comfort of the open air every where I go around the island.

Here is problem that I have encountered…..I LOVE protein, however – I find that I also just eat protein! I need to add colours to my diet, fresh veggies and fruits. Ive been working on my garden we have been having unbelievable weather in Canada and it looks like we are going to have an early summer – and it might be a brutal hot summer. We made it through the winter with less snow that ever! My husband shoveled once! So I have been itching to get this garden in since February when the weather was beautiful!! Its almost that time but we are still getting frost in the morning! I have turned the soil and getting ready for the compost to rake in!
I had asked that question of Pastor Fred, too, and he had replied that he had never seen anyone struggle as much as I had, but he assured me that God knew what He was doing and at some point the struggle would end.

Also in this process we have been getting repetitive signs that we may have been ignoring or putting on hold – these are to give up any kind of addiction or negative habits / patterns /behavioural tendencies, as they rob you of your heart’s true desires. Your heart yearns for love and peace, yet the toxins in your body (whether physical, emotional or mental) are polluting and blocking the flow and are dis-allowing the good to come in. You can ask Archangel Raphael to pour his copious healing green light over you. Bathe in this green essence and feel the healing beginning to occur. Clear yourself of toxins to cleanse and purify you and also ‘bring you back to earth’ in a more natural state, grounded, pure, and clear. Set the intention to be clearer vessel and to honour your heart’s true desires.

But let's say you've practised abstinence. It's your wedding night, and high time for a thorough seeing-too. For God knows how long you've both restricted yourselves, and now your rules allow for...well, anything, I guess. Where do you start?
I bought this top from Primark yesterday or today depending what time they say this was posted! You may of seen the navy and white collared version on here a week or so ago.. yes I'm addicted to peter pan collars or well any collars really and at the moment Primark have some seriously lovely tops in at the moment I've bought 4 already and there is another one I'm definitely getting my hands on if my store ever have it in my size! The locket was a gift off someone before I left for uni and the cardigan is my old faithful from Dorothy Perkins I've had it for years but I still wear it all the time even though its becoming holey.

- Think fetch is an outside-only game? Think again. Like the regular Chuck-It, it features a long handle that lets you pick up the ball and throw it again and again without bending or touching the slobber on the ball. The soft bouncy “donut”-shaped ball is gentle on surroundings such as furniture and easy for your dog to carry around in his mouth. The bright coloring also makes it great for dogs with poor eyesight.

It's being a while since I started thinking of this,of how different Mtf and FtM are,like,I know how is the feeling of hating your body and thinking that you should have been born in the other gender,but still is very hard to try to think of how is like to want to be a guy,or hating to be a girl.It's funny,because if is hard to me to understand,it must be really hard to cisgender people to get it too,and it's even worst because they don't have the feeling of wrong body.

The preceding paragraphs were written shortly after February 28, 1993, when the Waco massacre occurred. One would have to be blind not to see the many losses of liberty that have occurred since then. The following article will explain how and why we are losing our constitution.
2. Gratitude: It’s no secret that I believe gratitude is important and there isn’t a moment that goes by during the day when I do not say ‘thank you’ to one of my children for whatever they are doing. It is literally at the end of nearly every sentence I speak to them and most other people I come in contact with. When you approach a person or situation from a state of gratitude, like love, you acknowledge and validate the individual or experience as having value and purpose.
If you think of it please pray for us. Reliving this is very difficult. The enemy loves putting negative thougths in our heads, making us question why we are doing this to ourselves. But we know we are doing exactly what God has told us to do. We are living our Genesis 5020.
The second is failure to apply the lessons of admitted mistakes. To its credit, the Government has admitted the failings of outcomes-based education but the ANC nevertheless plans to forge ahead with a national health system without considering the State's capacity constraints.
Despite all this turmoil, the man in the center of the photo, Humphrey Bogart, was doing all right. Still a major star, he had recently finished work on The Caine Mutiny , where he played the ball-busting, and ball-twiddling, Captain Queeg. His last great iconic performance, he would soon be nominated for an Oscar, though he would lose to the man who, a few years earlier, had lost to him, Marlon Brando. Could Bogart have stayed a major star all the way into the 1960s? We'll never know. See that cigarette in his hand? Kind of fits his tough guy image, huh? In three years he'd be dead of throat cancer.

"Shamokin" recounts how one night on tour the band played a sold-out show in front of thousands on a bill with The English Beat; the next, they were performing for a handful of punk rock kids in this poverty-stricken, no future ghost town of a coal town near Scranton, PA (even though the mines have been closed for years, a funeral pyre-like fire still rages in one of them a mile underground). "Shamokin" is the post-WWII 1950s American dream/teenage rockstar fantasy gone bust. The American manufacturing industries that once employed millions and allowed them to provide a decent and secure middle-class way of life for their families abandonded them in favor of cheap, benefits-free Third-world labor--devastating countless communities in the US its wake (how un-patriotic can you get?). Likewise, the music business, indie or major, essentially has been rendered obsolete by the terrible advent of file sharing--how can you earn a living as a full-time musician if your fans expect to download your music for free and can't tear themselves away from their computer, smartphone, or TV screens to pay a couple of bucks see you play a gig? "Shamokin" is the heart, soul, and conscience of Bigger Thomas wrapped up in one tune: what do you do when you can't do what you love to live?
Urabe’s refrain is “I don’t need friends”, but after what happens in P.E., perhaps a better way to phrase it is “it’s best if I don’t have too many friends,” after Oka gets her wounds. Being friends means sometimes sharing feelings and sometimes pain; in this case, literal physical ailments – which is a crazy supernatural power that the series presents in a surprisingly low-key manner. Both Urabe and Oka (and Tsubaki for that matter) simply accept that this is how drool works. What surprised us most of all was Oka using a drool test to determine how far Urabe’s gotten with Tsubaki, proving that Urabe isn’t the only one who can administer such a test.
It’s hard to believe that the 138th running of the Kentucky Derby is less than a week away. Last year, I was fortunate enough to tab longshot Animal Kingdom as the winner, before I stubbed my toe in the Preakness and Belmont. The year before, I swept the Triple Crown, including the cold trifecta in the Belmont Stakes. Let’s see if we can get another streak going next Saturday.
“The new record feels like a great combination of everything we've done as a band up to this point,” explains Lambert. “It has catchier hooks, bigger breakdowns, as well as bringing back all of the gang vocals, and gang singing, varied styles of screaming, and it has a faster more punk influenced vibe in a lot of places that we're really excited about. We all grew up as kids listening to pop punk as well as hardcore and metal so it feels right having the faster paced and more intense feel in the new songs, while as the same time adding even catchier and more pop oriented choruses.”
Maybe we should take a moment and breathe. Stop trying to push God into our box and let Him take things at His own pace. There’s no need to rush perfection. Let Him take care of everything.

Its best to get away from the city now and meet thousand year old villagers and really try to understand why the issue is more complicated than a simple man caused ecological disaster, than simply 'feudalism.' To drink at the fountain of their wisdom.

I have a "fun money" account and for the past couple of years I've been setting aside my birthday and holiday money with the intention of buying something fun and frivolous. I've been toying with the idea of getting an e-reader. Do I need an e-reader? No, absolutely not. I have hundreds of books sitting on my shelves, waiting to be read/reread, not to mention the easy access I have to thousands of library books at library branches all across the county. But again, the money is for something fun and frivolous, which to me, an e-reader is.

M.S: Writing about a German immigrant in Minnesota in the early 20th century was almost an autobiography in reverse--as though I were writing in a dark, inverted mirror. In fact, I was a Minnesota-born expat living in Germany in the late 20th century, pouring my sense of transcultural alienation and wondering where "home" really was into Kathrin's story.

Analysis of “tradecraft” in above clip: Sarah = (“the mark”) woman kissing Todd = (“green cap kitty”) —theater of operation = (“box”) — players arrive w/mark, get into position, await signals– green cap kitty in place (left screen) — cameraman in place w/perfectly framed shot of “box”– distraction team in place along sidelines as cheering crowd– grab man (last to enter box) rides behind Todd, gets off machine, for “grab n blind” —pulls Sarah into his large, tall frame; she’s literally in the dark as he keeps her back toward top of box, while “tongue-swap” is in play. Todd enters box, rides past Sarah to center frame (no kiss) awaits green cap kitty approach–Ops split box in half – acting as human shields/barricades, ensuring Sarah fixed at bottom of “box.”–they even have back-up “hand-off” men, just in case “grab man” let’s go too early; ck out guy in orange vest at halfway point of box, and guy at left posing as photographer…Ops distract Sarah, oblivious to Todd/green cap kitty’s tongue swap. Listen as cameraman provides voice over, gleefully announcing –”Todd’s getting that!”– laugh track provided by extras– green cap kitty takes mocking look towards Sarah at bottom of “box” after tongue swapping ends — Towards end of clip, you actually see “radio man” (in contact w/”grab man”) walk past camera w/earpiece in plain sight (called a glory shot). Todd’s “Kiss-N-Diss” film closes w/green cap kitty visibly exited fr (7sec) kiss (tongue hanging out her mouth)– cameraman ends film w/sarcastic quip “hugs for Sarah“– pans up to finish line for clip ending…well done! Last voice heard on clip is Sarah’s exclaiming “Piper…!” – serious mocking/ridicule here – Todd displays full control of Alaskan Kitty (Artic Cat) riding past his checkered flag waving wife/daughter, to tongue swap green cap kitty w/so many Alaskans in on joke. Todd Palin shout out to his Masonic Bros. on Global Management Team…”I’ve got the Kitty under control…ready for roll out”…

I remember this book being thoroughly shocking when I was teenager, filled with sex and ongoing incest. From an adult and parental perspective, the abuse and neglect seem more shocking to me now. The "constant" sex is, in reality, one brief scene that is not described in detail.
Reuters had an interesting article about the undertow that is dragging new home owners underwater if they borrowed with low down payment loans guaranteed by the FHA.
Rdio comes in second for playlist creation ease of use. You can create a playlist right on the playlist page with a search box that allows you to click on the return list to add a song to the list, but the MOG way of creating playlists is just better. You can even play a song from the search results to verify you’ve got the right version.

The story: last spring, Sara came to a Prima Vox rehearsal laughing and telling us that she'd just seen an ad in the shopper for Goats for Sale: $5. I couldn't help thinking "The Five-Dollar Goat" would be a great title for an Irish jig. But we were set to rehearse magnificats and psalms and Hildegard chants that day, and the drones and the harmonies pushed the idea of the jig to the back recesses of my mind.
The Rio payload, on the other hand, was uniform and round... each and every one. Also noticed, the wad in the Rio load seemed built to higher standards. This was evidenced by the powder flakes that had migrated into the shot on the S&B loads, but not on the RIO shells.
In recent days, I’ve had several interesting conversations about female friendships. And after seeing so many friends in New York, it’s made me appreciate those old bonds and what they mean to me more than ever.

Step 1. At the end of the last post, you had finished the knit row, and you now need to turn your work around. At this point in time, you will always be working from the right side of your stitches to the left, ie the stitches are transferred from the left hand needle onto the right hand needle, as you have knitted or purled.

“I know many things.” The centaur said, in his calculated tone. “I know of your purpose here, I know of your past and of what is to come.”
But what truly kept nagging me as the film wore on was the question of why I was supposed to be thrilled by the police stomping out these nondescript people in this building. I wouldn't call it fascistic, per se, certainly not in the way that, say, The Elite Squad is (this is perhaps the one area where the film's lack of story works; if it had even a whisper of one it would likely be in support of this police brutality). There is something, though, unsettling about how gleefully the film moves into a brawl, especially given that the first building resident the audience meets is a decent, meek man just trying to get medicine to his wife. How many others like him are caught in the crossfire of this raid?
The next day, Sookie is invited to a secret sex party organized by Mike Spencer. Afraid to go alone, Sookie asks Eric to accompany her as Bill is out of town. At the sex party, Sookie is surprised to see her friend Tara and her fiancé, Eggs, and learns that Mike and Tom Hardaway murdered Lafayette. The party is interrupted when Bill, Andy Bellefleur, Sam (collie form) and the maenad gather in front of the house. The maenad enjoys the drunkenness and lust of the party participants and eventually kills them all, except for Tara. Bill and Eric burn the house, and Eric glamors Tara so that she will be unable to remember what happened at the sex party.

Owning a 5D Mark III or any FF D-SLR won’t actually make you professional. It will just indicate that you’ve passed the test in learning photography as your passion. (Sooner enough, I’ll own that 5D Mark III, whether it has articulate LCD or not, but it’s really different if the LCD’s only articulated, though! Nobody touches my future camera. It’s my future boyfriend! HAHAHA!)
As I have previously held no particular view over the ancient lineage claims for Witchcraft, Wicca and Paganism in Great Britain, and their authenticity or lack thereof, and because I have followed a largely intuitive path similar perhaps to that of a Hedge-Druid in my relative independence of groups and traditions as regards my own awareness of Pagan and nature reverencing issues and of what I shall term Supernature and its apprehension in daily life, I have found this volume to be informative, enjoyable and unexpectedly provocative. That there ensues some degree of partisan prejudice was almost to be expected, as the wider public may still hold various oppositional perspectives based on an until recently dominant Christian cultural ideology and its ensuing misinformation against Paganism and Witchcraft in particular. That such views should apparently inform an objective academic in his choice of how to handle his subject matter is not a question that I am well enough equipped to consider. I would surmise however by saying that I have learned a lot by reading this work, both within the tome itself and further by becoming aware of sensible and informed dissent without.

‘Indeed. Irish tyres hissing slick on the sweat of the German tax-payer, who will tell you that he has paid for every last yard of straight road built here in the last forty years. You know,’ she said, ‘there have always been those who turned their back on Brussels and Frankfurt, and not everyone who professes to ourselves alone is a Sticky or a Shinner. But I could never understand that. I quite liked the idea that Herr Fritz was spreading around his Marshall Plan largesse to buy himself some badly needed friends.’ She shrugged. Her voice gone dead and cold, as if she spoke from inside a tomb. ‘Perhaps I was wrong. Herr Shylock has returned demanding his pound of flesh, and it appears he is charging blood debt rates. Straight roads, certainly, and more suicides in the last year than died in traffic accidents.’

1. Dr. Hagelin: Last week, Maharishi declared that, in truth, there is no difference between the unmanifest Unified Field and its manifest expressions in the universe: “Between the unmanifest and the manifest, there is nothing; it is the same thing.” Maharishi also said this unified reality of life is explained in the Nyaya Sutras of the Vedic literature: “Nyaya is the lamp at the door; the outside and the inside meet at the door.” My question for Maharishi is this: If there is no difference between the outside and the inside, ultimately, then what is the door that stands between them?
American Pale Ales like Southern Star’s Pine Belt are quite popular and are an adaptation of English pale ales to reflect local ingredients native to America, often without heavy hopping and a less caramel flavor than their English counterparts. Southern Star’s Co-founders Dave Fougeron and Brian Hutchins began production of their first signature brew in March of this year from their 10,000 foot warehouse in Conroe. Southern Star Brewing Company is the one of the only microbreweries in the state of Texas to package their craft beer in a can.

Ever have one of those moments where your mind just goes blank? And the rest of you goes blank? No other thought existed in my head except for the "I have to listen to that song". So I found it on Spotify. And I played it. It took me back to a time when a certain French Canadian boy introduced me to such music. I still know the lyrics to this song. And I don't speak french :)
Brandon and I continue to learn more about each other every day. After over 8 years together, that is pretty incredible! One thing we have seemingly had to relearn after having Brayden is the way we talk to each other in front of others. We like to joke a lot, make fun of each other's misfortunes throughout the days for a good laugh, and its not all the time either. We tend to pick on each other, especially to cheer the other one up if they have had a rough day, but sometimes this can get taken the wrong way by others if they aren't around us 24/7.

The police do nothing except hide the truth for fear of breaching the dictates of political correctness, and the case of Charlene was handled so incompetently by the police and the CPS that the scum who murdered her were acquited AND THEN GIVEN £250,000 BY THE COURTS AS COMPENSATION FOR BEING KEPT ON REMAND.
I remember the first time I watched “Mulan.” It was at my best friend’s eighth birthday back in 1998. Even now, it’s one of my favorite movies. Sure it’s adorable and funny, but I think the movie sends out a strong message to young women: you can be your own hero. You don’t need someone’s permission to play with the big boys. You can defeat any enemy on your own. And you certainly don’t have to wait for a handsome prince to rescue you.

I’ve made some good thrift store finds. Some things I’m super excited about upcycling. My family doesn’t love my finds. They just don’t see the potential. Bummer. But the good news is they like the finished products. My challenge is just to get to the finished product part. I’ve written before about not being a closer. Its not my strong suit, but small projects are a lot easier to finish. And I love seeing my progress.

One day, a snake charmer visited a government clinic with his sick wife. After a little wait, the government doctor gave the patient a consultation. The snake charmer expected free medicines but the doctor gave him only a prescription. “Buy the medicines from a pharmacy,” he told the poor snake charmer.

Alright, new start: “There’s no escape. I’m God’s lonely man.” Wait, wrong movie again, right? No–Scorsese decided to borrow from his other film, Taxi Driver, and put some of that post-war psychotic veteran storyline into this film. Clever, Scorsese, very clever. At least you can copy off yourself–then it’s not considered cheating…right? (Some teachers will dispute this by saying “Submitting the same paper twice is cheating, even if you wrote it yourself.”)

At about 3:30p we boarded the boats again and traveled to Tortuguero Village. You are given an hour and a half to explore on your own then board the boat or leave at your leisure and walk the beach back to the lodge. After this, I promise my complaining will end. Tortuguero Village exists, as it is now, for tourists. Surprise, surprise. It was like getting off a cruise ship and directed to the ‘local’ shops peddling ‘handmade’ goods really mass produced by little children somewhere. I know that’s incredibly cynical, and most-likely ignorant, but that is how I felt. I felt stared at and stereotyped. The village is beautiful, though. A thin strip of land, now an island because of a past earthquake, lush and abundant with life.

Speaking of upholstery, I wanted to thank Modenus for featuring a before and after of my Boston Townhouse Living Room project on their website today. This was a project that included several upholstered pieces. The sofa was a Dapha for Baker Furniture with Stroheim & Romann fabric (both to the trade), the arm chairs were Mitchell Gold + Bob Williams (retail) with a Robert Allen washable velvet (COM to the trade) and the side chairs were Restoration Hardware in their own velvet (all retail). I point this out because I think it's a good lesson in using varied resources to achieve the best results on a project. Retail store furniture can often be covered in COM (Customer's Own Fabric) or COL (Customer's Own Leather), so never hesitate to ask. It may be more expensive, but to get exactly what you want, it's worth it.

A few years ago the British company »Tower of London« treated the GK community with the release of a classic Jeff Yeagher sculpt: »Mr. Hyde« from the Paramount Pictures version of »Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde« from 1931.

This is one of the longest books in single volume that I have read. It was released with lot of hype in 1993. To some extent it lived up to the expectation but still it was a very long book. I remember having struggled to get it from library for reading. The story of “A Suitable Boy” is about a mother’s search for a suitable bridegroom for her daughter Lata’s marriage. Lata is young and vulnerable and ready to fall in love and not get influenced by her mother’s choices. At the same time, there are pressures of society and culture. But with that central story the book is also a commentary on post Independence India.
Third, philosophy could not possibly have come to exist without philosophers having an interest in the universe. That is philosophy basically started as an attempt to do science.

My newest collection is appropriately named the “Express Yourself Series". This collection comes from deep within my imagination, my love of art, personal insecurities and the need to become a better and happier person. I think that art should be an expression of who we are and the things that are important to us so I have created these designs to allow myself and others to say what is often on our minds. Most of the new sentiments in this series are my own original thoughts, and feelings. They are meant to be uplifting, and encouraging to those that need to believe in themselves more (something I have always struggled with).

To date I have lost 12 pounds and dropped a size. YAHOOOOO!!! The weight loss has been slow (in my opinion), but my chances of keeping it off are greater according to statistics if I lose approximately 1 pound a week, rather than rush things along with a faster weight loss.
I picture invitations going back and forth that sound something like this:
After years of good loyal service it is with sadness that I have sold my 18 year old, much loved, VW Cabriolet. The only car I have ever liked so much that I kept it for so long, even taking to Canada and back! Most cars only last about a year before they get sold on.
Today, in the workshop, I caught her smell, faint, sharp, metallic, unmistakable. It is the smell of metal-polish - she must have been doing the silver that day. I was so happy when I identified it! Anything seemed possible. It even seemed that someday I might wake up and see, coming forward from the darkened room into the frame of that doorway which is always in my mind now, a child, a girl, one whom I will recognise at once, without the shadow of a doubt. However, when I read that quote to John just now, he snorted, and I must say that in view of Freddie's earlier comments about certainty, that without the shadow of a doubt possibly has an ironic ring.
I tell all this not to elicit pity, but to illustrate why even the years I spent unschooling, living free and following my passions and sleeping and eating exactly when I felt like it, were also filled with pain and depression and a very real sense that the world didn't want me around to sully its reputation. The world told me that I was a leech and a sinner, and that my mom, who is perhaps the gentlest person in the world, should be locked up somewhere. I heard subtle and not-so-subtle messages coming from everywhere saying I shouldn't have been born. My suicidal ideation came not from the sense that I wanted to die, but from the sense that I did not deserve to live. My mom could tell me over and over that I was fine just like I was, but she couldn't get the whole world to shut up and leave me alone. The fact that she didn't add to the chorus of disapproval was immensely helpful, but she couldn't silence it. She didn't have that power.

The same reference to this spiritual ‘food” is also found on the New Testament of John, where Master Christ Jesus confirms the significance of the spiritual dew as the main source of divine inspiration and spiritual transformation. Only the “crystalline and pure” minds can apprehend this gift and replicate the benefit to the rest of the body.

Yesterday's post about RAKs got me to thinking. The purpose of these challenges are to leave your descendants with more information about you: your likes/dislikes, your hopes/dreams, your everyday life. More importantly, though, we want to show our future generations WHO we are/were as people. To know the true me (and you) so that they can have a better understanding of us.

“It was intended as a failsafe by my brethren, but we soon discovered there were those among us who wished to use our inventions for selfish purposes. The benevolent of us destroyed the Doorways to prevent them from falling into idle hands. All save one. When Illmatar fell, I knew the Citadel would be next. To ensure the plague and the Trespasser would not gain entrance to the Summit, I invoked the power of the Doorway to conceal the entrance and hid it within the mechanism. It will only open at your behest.”
Despite the closest store on campus being down several flights of stairs and a large hill which is required to climb to return and enjoy our ice cold goodness, me and my roommates go down almost every night to buy drinks. It's worth it, since they sell half gallon jugs of orange juice, just enough to quenche my thirst for one anime marathon. Or for at least an hour or two. (That's why I bought more.)
7. Principles and integrity. A good life ends with a feeling of integrity — that the person has lived up to his or her dream.

As the ferry pulls up to Muff Island *juvenile giggle*, Skip and Arch get into an argument about Stretch. Arch angrily informs Skip that he doesn't want to play anymore, then whips the knife at Skip. It lands in Skip's stomach, and he staggers backwards into the water. Nan's horrified scream gets the attention of the deckhand(HA! I thought of the word!), who dives into the cold water to rescue Skip. Then Rob jumps in as well. As they search under water for the body, Skip himself pops up, revealing that the switchblade was a fake.

Both of our boys love doing puzzles. For some reason we have stored our puzzles in our TV cabinet and not in the IKEA Expedit, with the rest of the toys. I think it is probably because it's something they like doing sitting on the carpet.

“red rover, red rover, send Tiffany right over”. Y’all remember that game? If you broke
A bit frosty around the edges! Actually, we fared pretty well last night. The thermometer on the porch was reading 29F this morning when I got up at 5:40 am. A tad bit chilly after the 80 degree temps we've been having recently. Amazingly, while a few things got nipped around the edges (mainly in the herb garden) most everything looks to have survived pretty well. The apple blossoms look OK but it's hard to tell. The strawberries already have buds on them but I don't think they're developed enough to have taken much damage. Still, we've got some cold nights ahead early next week so we'll see how we come through.
‘”Is it lawful to pay the taxes to Caesar or not? Should we pay or should we not pay?” The question itself is illuminating. As the text tells us, they were trying to use Jesus’ own words to trap him. If they put this question, then, it was because it was already being debated. Jesus had the reputation of being hostile to Caesar.’

The BP webpage summarizes the film as, "set at an Italian petrol station where various characters pass through on their onward journey, while entertaining and playing with the attendant's daughter, Giuseppina."
If suspected perjured evidence results in an acquittal, then a prosecution might be brought, although this would need to be more than an attempt to re-try the original case by other means.

A couple of years ago while searching for comforting words to offer a friend I examined that saying more closely. I asked myself, so what if someone is strong enough to endure, does that knowledge or belief really make it easier? Does it take away the pain? Does that mean that stronger people are destined to endure more difficult trials simply because they are stronger? How is that fair? Who would want to be stronger if only to endure more pain? Suddenly this saying meant to bring comfort seemed to be doing the opposite.
Yes, it’s gotten to that point. God, Jesus Christ are all given special place on the radio, television and social media sites where I supposedly stay in close contact with friends and family. Their logos and slogans are everywhere. I don’t see or hear an awful lot of Vishnu, Shiva or Allah in my little corner of the world but I’m quite sure they are amply promoted outside my limited confines.
Hmm. Later.

These ETs appear to be the same people who appeared in ancient civilizations around the world and were labeled as “gods” or “angels.”
Now this family is looking at $3,000,000 plus in doctor bills. Not to mention commuting two hours one way to the children’s hospital, and meals on the road and so on.
I used to live in Eastern Washington and can tell you that most of central and eastern Washington is a dry, hot, dusty, sparsely populated……… pit……. but in a scenic sort of way. (Just like 2/3 of my state of Oregon) Whereas the “Pit” areas of central and eastern Oregon are not thriving with wineries because not much besides tumbleweeds will grow in that dry desert climate, the Columbia Valley area of Washington is exploding with wineries, because of one feature…. the Columbia River.
Fourth, another clear indication that the Church herself intends for the teaching of Leo XIII to be considered to be a principle that should be applied broadly, comes in its application to the six days of creation. The Pontifical Biblical Commission, which was a magisterial office at the time, issued this statement in 1909 concerning the language of Genesis 1 – language that clearly hearkens to Leo XIII’s Providentissimus Deus:
It's not particularly important, except to me, as I'm excited about making a venue for myself to continue to explore why I find this manga/anime worldl so fascinating. Some of it might bleed over here, but only if it has a direct bearing on my novels (and, yes, manga has had an impact on no less than four of my five completed novels).

You have just finished a tough workout at the gym and are looking for a drink to satisfy your thirst. You begin to reach for a Gatorade when you see a cold bottle of chocolate milk calling your name. Chocolate milk provides a nutritious amount of carbohydrates and protein to replenish your muscles.
So from this we see that Epaphroditus came from Philippi and brought with him an offering of money to help Paul in this time of physical need. Doubtless there were others, for from Acts 21:14 there were many along the way who were praying for him.
I was able to get some information about Peter today, from another family who has adopted from his orphanage. Peter has been on Reece's Rainbow his entire life. Not one inquiry has ever been made about him.

In other words, the Exchange will not necessarily be limited to a minority of the population – potentially, 100% of the population not covered by Medicare or Medicaid could get access to the Exchange, and thus the public option. However, as I’ve pointed out, what this means is that the progressive community will need to mount an employer campaign to move people onto the Exchange, and then onto the Public Option. Luckily, the American labor movement knows how to do employer campaigns – that’s what Justice for Janitors was all about – and thus has the potential to push their own employers to move their health care plan onto the Exchange and the Public Option through the normal process of contract negotiation, potentially dramatically improving the “competitiveness” of unionized firms against their non-union competitors. The issue, as I’ve shown elsewhere, is that this will require a fair split between workers and management of the labor savings this involves.
It is also important that we look at our infrastructure to improve the quality of English instruction. How many public elementary and high school have audio-visual room and speech laboratories? How many of them have libraries? How many of them have teachers who are specialist in reading or literature?

Here is the first shirred blouse I ever made. I really LOVED this one, even though it's not quite perfect. The straps are proportioned correctly, but a bit too short. You can see the side of the bodice folding over a little bit. I also started the first row of shirring a little too low. It ruffles out a bit too much for my taste. So, again, not perfect.

The music that we all now know as industrial dates back to the ’70s and originates from Germany and the United Kingdom. So, when it comes to the industrial, aggrotech, and even electronic rock scene, Germans know their shit.

To be perfectly honest readers, there really is no good reason to cheat. It is an unjustifiable action performed by people who clearly don’t care about the people they could hurt. If you love someone, are truly happy with them, then you would never feel the need to go elsewhere. If you feel yourself drifting towards other sexual partners, you need to re-evaluate your relationship, because the chances are you shouldn’t be in it anymore. So the next time you feel the urge to cheat, assess the ramifications and decide if it’s really worth it.

I’m pretty much done. I hope this post has been informative to those of you who have made it this far. It’s certainly helped me to clarify a few points in my own mind. I’m still not sure whether Schieber’s argument is a good one — and I’m still trying to imagine how Craig might respond to it (suggestions below please). Nevertheless, I do have two concluding observations that might stimulate some conversation, even if they don’t address all significant points arising from the preceding dialectic.
Hats off to DC Thompson for pulling out all the stops on this relaunch (and in the middle of a recession too). I really hope they pick up a large new readership. My excuse it that I'm buying them for my son to read when he's old enough, but I guess we'll have to see what happens when he really is old enough! (perhaps I'd better buy 2 copies?!)

Maybe it was because the children were related in different ways that made them so different. Arguments flourished amongst the children. Yet there were never any real fights, and they got along whenever Summer was watching. Travis found Summer’s ability to raise a house full of children who behaved in the manner children should, attractive and enticing. “A woman in change of her own life and in total control of her children is the kind of woman, I want raising my children”, Travis thought to himself, as he decided to hitch his wagon to Summer’s skirt tail.

Today I went to orientation for my new job, except not really. The orientation was for all new employees of the hospital system without being specific to anyone's job. I can see the advantage of covering general information that applies to everyone like benefits and safety. I could do without the extensive examination of the over-long mission statement. Plus there's the fact that I just went through the same orientation a year ago. I didn't sleep well the night before, so I was a little irritable when I arrived. Here are some notes I made:
Standard Industries Limited has submitted to the Exchange the Standalone Financial Results for the period ended March 31,2012.
For a couple of years, there was no furry face waiting for me to put some food out, though I continued to put a little out each night, just in case. Finally, in the Summer of 2009, a half-grown black and white tuxedo cat found the food and started coming, almost every day. I can't tell whether it's a he or a she, but, for some reason, I think of it as a him. He scares me in the Winter, because he doesn't come around for long periods of time, but, then, I'll see his tracks in the snow, or catch a fleeting glimpse of him. I think he can't make it, through the deep snow, and I worry that he will starve, before he can get back to the food.

The Great Orme brewery, based in the Conwy Valley, have been going since 2005, and I believe they sell quite well in North Wales, but this is however the first time I've seen their beer outside a festival.
The representative of ‘Save the Children’ made several recommendations to get rid of the said curse.
So I ended it! I talked over my options with my doctor, and he encouraged me to give an IUD – either in copper form, or the Mirena which is a plastic version with fewer side effects and lower possibility of pregnancy – a chance to do the job for me. I chose the Mirena because, even though it only lasts 5 years compared to the copper version’s 10, it gives me an even better chance of keeping from getting pregnant than the Pill ever did, and there’s a strong chance that after a few months, periods will completely stop all together for me. Which is my whole goal. There’s just no point to me having them at all. They’re annoyances that simply piss me off to have at this point in my life.
Even though I have written about all three bands before here is a brief run down of what the bands are like. Casa Negro played loud, bombastic post punk that is a lot like Shellac, Karp and GodheadSilo. Knox Overstreet were an awesome indie/emo band that meshed together the influences of Garden Variety,Superchunk, Afghan Whigs, the Replacements, Big Star, etc to create truly great rock music. The Lord Humongous played screamy hardcore that was a blend of all the best elements of Scapegrace, The Last Crime, Rorschach, "My War" era Black Flag, and Slint.
But, we’d rather find the remote and turn on the TV. Why? Because it’s painless and it probably involves less change. Instead of making changes, we can just stare and watch, and find entertainment in the idea of change, without actually having the discomforts of making change. Sometimes the remote feels safer. The book is less invasive. A stranger is easier to agree with my rationale. But does it really help when things get sticky?

When I’m afraid or worried I am unconsciously looking for what is wrong. If I don’t catch this, I’ll start attracting those energies and will end up having a rough ride instead of a relaxing journey. Fear, concern, or worry are all contracting, small energies. They are self-centered to the extreme, and are good indicators that I have forgotten that there is a huge, benevolent, Loving force running in, through and around me (and everyone else) and the only thing that I need to do to feel a part of it is to drop the negative thoughts and look for the love, connection and happy coincidences; to allow myself to be swept along by the arms of Love and to enjoy the trip!

Throughout the week, what little free time I had was spent focused on the Spurs. They closed the season on a 10-game winning streak, or 38-7 in their last 45, depending on how you want to look at things. In fact, if you subtract the two losses suffered on the road to Portland and Utah when Coach Gregg Popovich sat Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, and Manu Ginobili, the Spurs could have finished the season on a 40-5 tear. The first playoff game, Sunday’s cruise-control victory over Utah, provided these delightful moments: Ginobili 1 and Ginobili 2.

This paragraph replaces a previous, somewhat more upbeat, conclusion to this post.
However, here is a video courtesy of Youtube and Econsultancy that discusses common website mistakes:
When the recital was over, I went back to Sneed, grabbed some food, and then joined Andrew in the room. The Jason Segel movie Forgetting Sarah Marshall was on, which I hadn’t seen before, so we watched for a while before I hopped in the shower and then got ready for our choir concert on Saturday night. This concert wasn’t just us Matador Singers, though. It was all of the choirs combined together, so there were lots of us up there singing together. We sang along with the orchestra/band combo, which was really cool. We sang Mozart’s Requiem, which was really super awesome. The extra rehearsals leading up to the concert were awful, but I really enjoyed the performance itself.
A short time after entering the museum, I stopped under a re-creation of a lynching tree with several other visitors of various racial and age groups to watch a short video that showed numerous examples of violence against African Americans while three mannequins (a man, a woman, and a child) stood in the display case next to me outfitted in Ku Klux Klan outfits. I had seen these types of films before, but not in this context. I was honestly moved almost to tears by the sadness and disgust that I felt as I watched the video and am convinced that the only reason I didn’t shed any tears was because I was equally angry that people can be so vile and hateful because of a person’s skin color. As the video ended, I looked around at the rest of the crowd and recognized varied looks of sadness, anger, and stunned disbelief. After taking a moment to compose myself, I turned my attention to the aforementioned KKK display and was moved to sadness and anger all over again. The display talked about the role of women, men, and children in white supremacist organizations like the KKK, and I found it quite fitting that this trio that looked like a family stands together looking out at the lynching tree seeing as I learned about how lynchings were family social gatherings. Are you kidding me? How messed up is that? I guess I shouldn’t have been surprised since children have to learn to hate from somebody. Why wouldn’t it be a family tradition to practice and celebrate racist violence?

The smooth-type spaces mentioned in the second paragraph and the patron’s psycho-geographical maps, revisited from the perspective of control society, now appear programmed so as to prohibit a truly free motion, like the striated gives way to a smooth that itself reproduces striation, or some combination of the two. On the cruise ship there is a passage between smooth and striated space that seems linked to control; as Deleuze writes (if we imagine consumerism as a sort of religion): “Thus the great imperial religions need a smooth space like the desert, but only in order to give it a law that is opposed to the nomos in every way, and converts the absolute” (A Thousand Plateaus, 495). If, in the case of cruise ships, the smooth space is planned by the forces that striate, forces who, according to Adorno, basically employ the cruise to reproduce conditions of capitalism, what does that say about the still potentially productive experiences of the travelers?

I love this though! Its extremely brightening!

First, I just want to say that this news package did a really good job giving us the facts about the incident, while telling us the story of how it happened. I also like how towards the conclusion of the package the reporter shows the viewer what lighting an aerosol can’s spray stream looks like. I think it paints a more vivid picture of how badly the incident could have turned out.

Before you know it, not only are there MORE weeds than the farmer started off with, but ALL of them are resistant to his preferred herbicide. Also to be taken into consideration, most weeds are angiosperms meaning they flower and their seeds are mobile. Be they blown on the wind or carried by an animal, the seeds move. Nearby "foreign" populations of pigweed get transported into the farmer's field. Of the transplants some of them too will become resistant to the herbicide, exacerbating the problem. So too, do the resistant pigweeds transplant into the "foreign" populations taking their genetic advantage with them.

What makes this the most feminist film of the year is not just its portrayal of how Corinne’s faith infuses everything about her life and enriches her friendships, but how hard it is when she begins to lose that faith and her previous closeness to God. Instead, she begins to notice all the inequities in her life — the minister’s wife who wants to correct her behavior or dress; her husband’s insistence on wifely submission; her lack of other things that might fill the gap left by God and give her life meaning; the emptiness of her community’s anodyne promises of glory in exchange for obedience. At last: a film about Christianity that can be feminist, too.

Last week I talked about the truth, and how the truth is one of the building blocks of our lives. This is the predominant theme that runs through Jude. As Jude looks to close the letter, he adds what is called an ‘Exhortation to Believers’; basically Jude is trying to help prepare the believers for their necessary struggles as a consequence for living in the truth.[1]

I think the lesson is that just because a politician says one thing, it doesn’t mean that they’re going to do it. How can we trust our government then? I think there is something seriously flawed in our political, no societal, system today when liberties are taken away, politicians aren’t called out on their lying, and the media controls how we think so that we don’t even pay attention or care. Wake up, America.

The one who’s shirt has a picture of a moose, and states “Moose Valuable Player”, and is possibly the nicest boy on the planet? Well, that boy has a super power. Now, for all of you superhero aficionados out there who are worried that I shouldn’t be discussing someone’s super powers, relax. I doubt very much that he has the ability to use this particular power for the purposes of saving innocent people from the clutches of doom. If, someday down the road, my discussing his powers in this venue prohibits deeds of a good and noble nature, I apologize.

Slip it down quickly and get yourself a cocktail – a simple Moscow Mule will tide you through to the main courses without worry.

different labels to describe the same type of experience, an experience that we all seem to crave. These timeless moments align us with the truisms of who we are. They unify us with the world on which we spin. And they provide our souls with deep evidence that outside of the obvious mortal limitations we have on this planet, the perception of time is completely subjective, and just as it
The ransoms the large shipping companies are willing to pay to secure the release of their vessels and crews totals tens of millions of dollars, money that most certainly is used to further perpetuate piracy, secure weapons and ammunition, fast boats, GPS, satellite radios and so on.

Randomness is something that I am increasingly allowing in my work. This is not always easy, because I tend to want to control the way my paint gets on the paper or canvas. I want to control the outcome, but somewhere on the way I miss – or discard – a lot of great accidents that my materials might produce. As a way of forcing myself to allow randomness more frequently in my work, I started with a new daily project: making things out of random prompts. There is quite a challenge in this for me: about half of the prompts I wrote are related to themes or materials that I almost always avoid… because I’m not good in them, because I don’t like them, because I find them too difficult – or just because I never thought of using them before.
So.. today is all about the funnest part of writing, the work you do before you write.

Let us assume that it can be fairly said that priests and religious rely on the faithful. Can we say that, in terms of the social life of a community, that they "give nothing in return"? In terms of the priests, can one truly say that baptising our children, offering the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass, presiding at weddings, and otherwise tending to the spiritual welfare of the people, nothing? Certainly no Catholic would claim such a thing -- I shall assume then that Mr. "Vetus Ordo" meant that priests and religious are economic parasites only, and hence the claim that if 1/4 of the population were to devote their lives to Christ in this way, it would result in an "economic nightmare" because they give back nothing financially while relying on or even exploiting the faithful for any monetary income.

We count the hours and figure that the bus is going to arrive in Chipata at around 3am. We asked before we bought the tickets what that would mean for us. We were assured that the bus would stop and wait at the station until light, because there were lots of other passengers in the same situation. So, we are cramped on this awful bus (hungry and thirst, but too scared to put anything into our bodies). All I could do was hope that we wouldn't crash, and that if we did, it wouldn't be a painful death (I'm not being that dramatic). The bus stopped tons of times and people got off. By the time we got to our stop, it was just the 2 of us getting off and only a few other passengers left. We asked what time the bus was leaving "Now-Now" we were told. WTF, it's supposed to stay here till light! Nope, it was leaving now for the Malawian border. Shit Shit Shit. Lies! All LIES! It's 3am and we are in a dark bus station. NOT GOOD. So, Brittni got in the face of the driver and made him go talk to another bus driver. One that was actually staying until it got light. We looked in and there were about 10 women chilling, waiting for day. So, we got on that bus and slept until about 6am.

Many of us are sick and tired of the vicious cycle of Philippine politics. We elect new officials because we want change. We want election because we want change; and the people we have just elected are not satisfactory. This will be repeated and seems never ends.

Update: and just as I start making jokes about STDs, I lay eyes on this. I dunno that this untreatable gonorrhea business is particularly new, though. We've had untreatable STDs - from the ugly-embarrassing (herpes) to the lethal (AIDS) for decades. But we really, really need new antibiotics, and the morons in charge are too busy harassing the drug companies to be bothered with things like public hygiene.
Leading from my research into anarcho-primitivism the previous day, I did some research on various groups and organizations that seek to save the planet. The most extreme, and also most fascinating, of these is the Earth Liberation Front, or ELF. Deemed by the US government as one of the top American based homeland security threats. Despite that, they have yet to cause a single death, or even injury. They have, however, destroyed hundreds of millions of dollars worth of property, in the name of saving the environment (some targets have been: Mansions that put wetlands in danger, a ski resort that planed to cut down hundreds more trees, and similar things). Although I'm in no way in favour of blowing stuff up, I can understand with the world we live in how easy it is to get discouraged, and to feel that bringing it all down, piece by piece, is the only way left to go.

Monday 1st - Forest Meeting.
And he moved the ninth string from his harp crying out and saying: Glorious things are spoken of you O city of God (Ps. 87:3).
“The audience was struck by the many similarities in their perspectives,” Venkata says. “Both Dr. West and Radhanath Swami spoke about the idea that love has a private face and a public face. The private face can be expressed as devotion, full of intimacy and tenderness. And the public face, Maharaja said, is manifested as compassion, while Dr. West commented that it can manifest as justice. So a theme that emerged strongly in the discussion was that as people who are aspiring to be servants of God, we have a responsibility to express that love and live out that faith in the world around us.”

One of the explanations for the low wing ride height on the RB6 are suggested to be the splitter is allowing lower ride height by deflecting. Certainly trackside images suggest the Red Bull and the Ferrari are running significantly more rake in the set up at speed (i.e. nose down). Other teams suggest that this level of rake and low front wing ride height cannot be achieved with normal rear ride heights. But do not suggest how the car may be able to run that low. But the inference is that the splitter is in someway deflecting to allow this. I’ve not seen the detail of Red Bulls splitter mounting, but I doubt they are able to deflect the splitter without any obvious compliance in its mounting or undue wear to the skid blocks.
We had a good chat with him at the interval and joked about the Tyne, Wear and Tees. He being a Teessider and me a Wearsider (also know as a Makkem). 'Typical Makkem', he smiled as he signed a songbook for me that I hadn't paid for yet and turned out to be the only one not for sale because it had a glass-bottom watermark on the cover. He cleared it with his wife and authenticated it by placing his own glass over the mark. He recognised me as a Makkem as we each have our own distinct identity and dialect even though the rest of the country think we all sound the same.

Photographs and stories will appear in the near future, but at present I'm looking forward to the return of the Dillster, who has been for a fortnight's sojourn with the lemurs in Madagascar. I've asked her to look out for, and photograph, my all time favourite insect- the giraffe necked weevil (!) and now I'm on tenterhooks to see whether she's pulled it off. I'm guessing not, but the long suffering one seldom fails to surprise me.
The hall laughed at me and the lecturer shook his head sadly before continuing. ‘An equiatic bind is a unit of measurement for weighing time. Time weighs different things in different situations. If you have an hour at work with nothing to do then the time passes more slowly and is therefore heavier and is worth more equiatic binds. If you have an hour at work and tons of tasks the do the time will pass quicker and be therefore lighter and worth less binds.’

He lived in them as the Son of God, and He said that “the disciple is not above his Master.”

Make no mistake, Anders Breivik would kill us all if he believed it would “defeat” Islam. He would lay down the lives of our wives and children and smile smugly whilst declaring himself a saint. He has become what he most fears. A psychotic religious nut job determined to defend the “great truth”against the “great satan” regardless of the cost. Somewhere, deep in a cave in the Tora Bora mountains of Afghanistan, a mad mullah is smiling at his creation- a worthy adversary to the swivel eyed Jihadists who relish the spilling of blood and carnage of body parts in the name of their religion.
If you don't know the connotations of 'vespers', Vespertine sounds like a precious stone or some medieval craft of glasswork. "I was thinking hibernation and frozen things," says Björk. "The album is frozen, like crystals. It's a winter album." Her best yet, it reminds me of the jackfrost wonderland of Cocteau Twins circa 'In The Gold Dust Rush', of the bejewelled coldness of Siouxsie & The Banshees circa A Kiss In The Dreamhouse. The glittering sound fits the album's idea of inner riches, the treasure people keep hidden inside.

The days were stretching into an unnavigable maze of ennui. He spent most of his time walking the pedestrian rich streets of Shedsug Capital under the shadow of Crepuscular Hi and ticking off the times he saw the girl/woman standing on walkways, lingering on the green spaces below trees or crouching over flower beds. Frank stayed away from the business district and stuck to the less traveled avenues, eschewing the raw hustle of the city's workforce that was stampeding itself through the day. He rarely went back to the rented room, but occasionally he needed to synthesize more of the brew he subscribed to and sleep. A few hours rest was all he ever needed. As the days grew longer in tedium, he tended to tune out, turn off, and just evaporate into his general surroundings.
My life was all about my people. I had people. I don’t know what the hell that means, or who we were, but I was surrounded by brothers, cousins, extended family all around. Our hair was dark, our skin was white, the men wore undershirts and dark pants all the same shade of beige, gray, black. I walked through the dim city streets, grit crackling under my boots, sooty fire escapes overhead, fear in my heart. Still, I wanted to fight, like an alley cat that bristles before it is cornered and devoured by a pack of wild dogs. I wanted to fight because it was my in my blood, and because pride helped obscure the reality of my inevitable doom.

I wrote a month ago all about the "Final Leg" of our 3 1/2 year adventure. I explained very rationally why it was time to go home We were headed to La Paz like it was the barn at the end of a long day. We have lots of reasons to go home - a growing teen and lessening money being two of the chief ones, but there are a few others. I jokingly mentioned the possibility of pulling a Crazy Ivan and asked for any bettors. I did. You should have taken the bet.

And on Good Friday Jesus wasn’t dragged to the cross, or forced into the wolf’s den. Jesus boldly walked up to the wolf. Jesus followed the wolf home without fear or hesitation. He approached the wolf without weapons, without defenses, and without armies. Jesus sought out the wolf on his home territory, stood right in his face, and essentially said……give me your best shot. Do your worst. I dare you. I can take it.

It was clear that we were going to miss, by a mile, our connecting flight because of passport control, baggage pick up, and customs. I walked/ran NYC style to the USAirways counter to get there first (a very good move, BTW, maybe) to get on the first flight to Los Angeles. The ticket agents announce that they’ve made provisions for all of us, except, of course, they hadn’t.
Today was my third transition day, third day with a “real food” meal. Tonight I had halibut and asparagus. And realized how simple my life was on product! With the Optifast products, they are mostly ready to eat. Since I used the ready-to-drink shake, I just needed ice (others drank them right from the box). Bars, simple. Soup, just needed hot water. Easy to consume every three hours.
It is the first Friday night of the Fringe and the streets are sweltering in a high fever. There is an ugly confrontation outside C on Chambers Street, with a bouncer and an indignant thug staring each other down and lots of people edging forward to watch. One wants to retreat to the cool of the theatre, where everybody is middle-aged and sensible, but I have chosen to see Eva O’Connor‘s play “My Best Friend Drowned in a Swimming Pool,” and the audience are very young – about my age, in fact – and this play evokes their fashionably cynical world of hard drugs and empty sex. The evening is so hot that drowning in a swimming pool would almost be pleasant, but this play is more keen on the horrendous drowning than that inviting pool.

...we can continue on with more cerebral subjects. Speaking of cerebral, on one of our breaks during the class, I sat there, not saying a word (shocking, I know), waiting for the other students to say how much they hated the class. They were mostly British, so hatred was not forthcoming. (I imagine the same thing might happen in Canada.) But one of the students, comparing the first famous writer who spoke to us (Sarah Hall) to the second (Adam Foulds) said, "Adam is a little more cerebral than Sarah." This is an excellent example of a literary rhetorical effect called, understatement.

It took us this long to understand this, yet the Apostle Paul wrote nearly 2000 years ago, the exact same thing. Wives respect your husband. Husbands love your wife as you love yourself.

That picture has changed significantly. Now Heller's approval rating (not the exact same thing as the favorability we were measuring earlier in the year but pretty similar) is just 38% with 35% of voters disapproving of him. Independents still like him but only narrowly, breaking down 41/32 in their support for him. His appeal to Democrats has pretty much evaporated- their opinions of him now break down 12/59.
Kuroyukihime, then, gives him an installer to a program called “Brain Burst.” (Terrible name, in my opinion.) People can only attain this power by installing the program successfully, and as such, only a few people have that power to do so. They call themselves, the “Burst Linkers.” (Good name. :p) In the Accelerated World, it is created by the multiple social cameras as a 3D imagery reconstructed from footages. The thought process is accelerated by a thousand times faster. Thus, a second in the real world is equal to 1000 seconds in the accelerated world (16 minutes and 40 seconds). With this power, they make it possible by getting the bully off the school, getting not only Haruyuki from the punch, but also Kuroyukihime, a person looked up by everyone in the school.
I discovered the easiest way to find these emails was to do two searches using "notification" and "notifications" in the "Search Email" tab on GMail. Hundreds and yes, thousands of emails appeared when I did that! You can quickly scan to be sure there isn't something you want to keep (as other notifications may appear there that you want to keep), but it was very fast and easy to clear when I realized it half-way through my Clearing Day.
It has been awhile since my last post, I even missed last Friday's Fab Five. Please accept my dear apologies, this time of year is hectic for us all!

Since having children, it has been harder to go on mission trips the way I did in the past. My parents, now that they have finished raising children, annually go on medical missions to Cambodia, or China or other impoverished nations, but with three children in tow I cannot. However, there are those who can, and there are those people who go in my place, and this summer, one of my close friends CY, will go to Haiti to provide some relief there. She is the reason that I actually write this post, for she is hungry to help the people of Haiti. She wondered if perhaps I might be able to do something through my blog to help those hungry in Haiti and once she asked me, I knew I had to take action.
Of the Sun Glitters remix, frontman Tobias Wilner says “Our song “Lost” has been melted down and re-sculpted by Luxembourg-based beat-maker Sun Glitters. In some ways, his hot & heavy, soft-focus club sleepwalker remix keeps the original structure and beauty of our song, but it’s still lushy and dreamy with Sara Savery's (People Press Play) vocal in front. Sometimes when you get a remix back, you think ‘they totally destroyed my song,’ and sometimes it's just perfect. When I got this remix back from Sun Glitters I felt that something unexpected and beautiful happened to our music."

The 12 remaining children were then given injections of 25 mcg. of LSD and then days later were each given 100 mcg. of LSD once a week. Bender’s report states: “Then it was increased gradually to twice and three times a week as no untoward side-effects were noticed…. Finally, it was given daily and this continued for six weeks until the time of this report.”

What is so great about KATW is that they are family-oriented. They encourage children to come on the trips so they can see that they have an abundance of “things” at home when others don’t even have food to eat. The most touching story I heard was while we were in Guatemala. In Guatemala we worked very closely with an organization called Potter’s House. Potter’s House works closely with the children of Guatemala City that reside close to the dump and are children of “scavengers” or people who attain their livelihood from scavenging anything they can out of the dump. I have never seen poverty like that. The story was about a woman who was saying how it was a “good” day when she could scavenge fruit or vegetables for her children to eat. I lost it. I can’t believe that was the woman’s reality. The scavengers have it down to a science, they even know when all the fast food restaurants send over their trash. A lot of injuries occur in the dump due to the mass amount of people that scavenge, people get debilitating injuries that sometimes leave them forced to send their eldest children out to the dump or with an injury that they can’t ever afford to fix.
A guy got off of the plane and when we were outside he told me that he had cried on the plane. He, too, had an entire row on the plane to himself. He thought it was going to be the end. It was the first time ever that I thought to myself that I wished someone was sitting next to me on the plane so that I would have had someone’s hand to hold. I wished him luck in life…just in case we never cross paths ever again.

My first year at CalArts, I made a short animated film where I gave every object a lot of squash and stretch. Every object was bouncy and pliable. It was a lot of fun to animate (Early animated cartoons were often this way too - in early Mickey Mouse cartoons, Mickey could easily stretch out the tail of an airplane and make it longer. An airplane or a car was animated as though it was made out of the same material as a cow's udder or an animal's tongue).

Things only get worse as he turns to his new masterpiece, Welcome to Thonnet: a tale about a 17-year-old schoolboy who is (as he confesses coyly) perhaps a little like himself. The hero's name, Jay Giving, rhymes uncomfortably with Ray Living: he is a kind of pornographic Mary-Sue, a character invented by the author as a wish-fulfilment fantasy. Eventually it becomes clear that Living is a convicted paedophile, who is violating the terms of his parole.

To accompany the screening, the earliest surviving film about the disaster was shown beforehand. ‘In Nacht Und Eis’ is a short silent film released immediately after the real event in late 1212. This was accompanied by a wonderful live piano performance and the vibrantly colour-tinted print was pin-sharp (Remarkable for a film a century old) but sadly the acting wasn’t. The wild gestures used by the characters (The first Officer in particular) as they gaze terrified at the sight of a small lump of polystyrene floating in a pond (Meant to represent the towering iceberg) elicited howls of laughter from the audience!
Security experts agree that our security agencies are beginning to slice the sect. I am confident that soon, the more organized, more sophisticated operations of Boko Haram will gradually diminish. However, security agencies must be advised never to undermine the threat of lone Boko Haram Jihadists. They must proactively lookout for fresh extremist tactics such as book bombs and letter bombs, method Indonesian terrorist cells now use.

Something tells me that we’ll all have the sense to go to sleep at a reasonable hour tonight. Except maybe Joann, who is still traveling back to California. I’d stay up in solidarity with my dear sister, but…um…I have to make sure my pillow is properly broken in because it’s not gotten much use this past week. Yeah…that’s the ticket. Good stewardship of my pillow.
Legalized same-sex marriage exists in just eight states and the District of Columbia. In purely political terms, the swing states Obama needs for reelection—Ohio, Virginia, Colorado, and Florida—have all banned gay marriage. Now add North Carolina.
A few weeks ago their appeal against the bypass was rejected and rightfully so, why does the vocal minority always have to get their way when the vast majority are in favour of something? It doesn't seem to matter how wrong you are, if you shout your opinion as loudly as possible you'll always win. Now, if I'd gone to the effort to go to court over something and I'd lost, I'd take the hint and call it a day. Of course, that's too simple. Willy and co are to make a second appeal against the bypass.
Earlier during the weekend, I asked Madison who my favorite girl was. She squinted her eyes and pointed at Lynnette. I laughed. “Okay,” I said. “Who’s my favorite princess?” I asked. She smiled wide and tapped her own nose twice.

Hello! Angela Fehr here, wondering if you are seeing any spring flowers in your neck of the woods? We are still waiting on the first blades of grass around my hometown and I'm hungry for colour!
If there are perhaps some areas where you can still see the caning shining through, I stretched the fabric and sewed it in place to cover these up. Since I still have to tackle the front, I can take some pictures on the attaching technique. I assure you, its nothing that you can't handle. The most sewing I've ever done consisted of girl scout crafts in the 3rd grade and this turned out pretty okay! Neat!

The weather has been very wet lately, and the forecast was unsettled and changing by the hour. It generally included rain, though! I was kind of unsettled myself, deciding whether or not to spend the money on a half-day visit to a place I’d wanted to see for years.

This Abecedarian April challenge is forcing me to pour over my collection of dictionaries and history books in search of “new” old words that are no longer being used, at least to my knowledge. It completely cabobbles me why some of these words have been archived. Words such as croodle, which means to snuggle up to one’s mother like chicks under the hen’s wing. I mean, how sweet is that? What mother wouldn’t pull her baby close and whisper, “Come croodle with me, my wee sweet potato pie.” What about clamberskull? I mean, this word says exactly what it means: Strong drink that clambers to the skull. Need I say more?

From where I ascended the summit I would have to cover some distance to arrive at my perch. Walking over the giant slab rock I noticed two large black birds hovering over me at some altitude while riding the current of wind keeping them aloft. They must have noticed me as they started to descend. The birds were alternately keeping station and descending to a lower plateau getting lower and closer to me. I wondered, are these my spirit guides? As I was waking over the crater top the birds were maintaing a constant bearing and collision course as if they intended to land on my shoulder or on the top of my head. As the birds were descending they started looking bigger and bigger. They were close enough for me to identify them and reminded me of Edgar Allen Poe’s raven, but much bigger and not, definitely not, sitting on a perch in his study. I thought that they were ravens but I never in my life believed they were this big. Their wingspan was wider than I was tall. Being born and raised in the urban East Coast I never before saw ravens and I never before saw any birds this big. And these big birds were coming closer and looking bigger as I was crossing the open summit walking atop that big slab of a rock to my intended perch. Were these my spirit guides, I wondered aloud.

I then got onto the Penguin Graduate programme. It was an eighteen month programme where I got to work in lots of different parts of the business – marketing, publicity, sales, a stint in the Penguin US office as well as children and adult editorial. Because I got to work in so many different parts of the business I was absolutely sure that I wanted to work in children’s editorial at the end of the programme.

The “..good works” spoken of here are those works through which Jesus continues His ministry in us and through us for the Glory of the Father and the benefit of the community (cf., Acts 10:38). As His adopted children, then, we form the Body of Christ and, thus, are also the Father’s representatives or envoys in world to continue the ministry of His Son so that the Glory of the Father’s love may be manifested through us to all humanity.

I wasn’t looking forward to the drive tomorrow as it would be a long one. Tomorrow was also going to be the last night in the camper for Michelle and Jacob. The plan was to get to Greymouth for them to get the Trans Scenic Train to Christchurch where they would stay until Saturday. Aaron and I were to continue South to Mount Cook and the Franz Jospeh Glacier and meet up with them later on in the week. Aaron is a good traveller and sitting in the front would help enormously. Michelle and Jacob had had enough of camping and wanted to relax in a more comfortable environment for the remainder of the trip. The adults also need peace badly, without the two boys fighting continually, the only way was to split them up, so we did. As Michelle quite rightly said, she wanted the last memories of this trip to be a happy one, where we were all happy to see each other, even if it was due to a premeditated absence.
I have really enjoyed finally getting to read the run of Jack Kirby's post-apocalyptic comic book series KAMANDI. It reeks of the 1970s and is repeatedly clunky in its storytelling in a way the only Kirby could make endearing, but its pure energy and constant forward momentum is a blast. I'm loving ever mad issue!

To be honest, I don’t think God tells us how long we should keep believing. It’s funny, but God doesn’t seem to exist in our small minded understanding of time. His word says one day is like a thousand years in His eyes (2 Peter 3:8). So how long is long enough for God? It certainly isn’t according to our time table. So that means that we believe until we receive. Did God speak? If so, continue to have faith in what He said and be patient about it. It might be 1 day, it might be 50 years. But the strength of your faith is determined on your ability to keep believing in what He promised until He answers.

Veterinarians hate to give pet owners bad news. People today have a greater emotional attachment to their pets than in the past, and dogs and cats have moved from the farm and the backyard to being house pets. Not only do our four-legged companions sleep in the bedroom, many sleep in our beds.
The Cape's overall plot is super over the top, expecting you to suspend your disbelief farther than you might be comfortable with. The concept of keeping a secret identity in a digital age is a tough one. Don't know how Superman continues to do it.. but maybe you just have to let go in order to have fun sometimes (ex: those who picked apart the plot of Tron: Legacy and couldn't just enjoy the ride). Once you can have a sense of humor and let go, you open yourself up to more fun experiences. This goes for life in general. (Or you can just pretend everyone knows Vince is the Cape and they are just playing along to make him happy, it's also very funny that way.)

The key to the crunchy crisp skin is this secret ingredients...corn starch. What a valuable lesson I have learned from the Living Magazine! This is such a simple roast chicken that anyone can prepare. All you need to do is to wash and clean the whole chicken (believe it or not, this is a task that I took a while to pick up the courage to do!), pat it real dry, inside out, and rub some butter all over the skin, including under the skin. Butter will help the chicken to brown evenly. The next thing is to rub a combination of salt, pepper and corn starch all over the chicken, including the cavity and of course under the skin to add flavour to the meat. I like to add in some dried mixed herbs as I love the smell of the herbs when the chicken is roasting. It is perfectly all right to leave it out or you could do with some fresh rosemary (finely chopped). I don't truss the chicken as I don't know how to do it, plus, I think it is not an absolute must. The last step is to place it in a roasting pan (preferably one that comes with a rack, to encourage even browning) and leave it to the oven to the finish the job as it is not necessary to baste the chicken. In about an hour's time, you will be rewarded with a golden crispy chicken, not forgetting the inviting aroma of the roast chicken...I feel so proud for myself as I am very certain my neighbours could smell it and would probably think their neighbour must be a good cook!

You should in no circumstances become a double texter! There are some instances where it is okay to double text though. If you have an iphone, blackberry, or some other type of smartphone (and let’s face it – that’s everyone), then double texting becomes okay. HOWEVER you must send the texts straight after each other. This is okay because your texts are in the same thought and you’re using texting as an instant messaging service. If you wait for too long in between messages, then it just seems lame and like you have been thinking about them and waiting for a response.

That's it! . . . my day at The Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens. Thanks for reading along and I hope you enjoyed the tour. I thoroughly enjoyed my visit and plan to go back soon. Because the most important thing I learned on this day at The Huntington is this: what a luxury it is to have such a beautiful place so close to home. I realize that I take for granted all of the wonderful places I have nearby to see and experience and learn from. I take for granted that these places will still be there when I get around to going. Do you do the same thing? Put off for another day the beauty and history that's in your own backyard? Tell me about a great place near you that you've put off for later. And, tell me, when will "later" be? I hope for each of us, later comes very soon.
To be totally honest I think that album gets a bum rap by reviewers too...I was a cat that wasn't around listening to "People's Instinctive Travels..." and "The Low End Theory" when they first dropped. I had to go back and re-trace those albums after hearing ATCQ's later releases (sorry, I'm still kinda young) and even though I missed out on a lot of magic, I will always maintain that "The Love Movement" can stand up with their older work...

In the early days of the 1870s and 80s, before the trains came in, Coney Island wasn’t a place for day trippers. The two attractions were a) the enormous resort hotels, like the Manhattan Beach, the Brighton Beach and the Oriental, where families would stay for their vacations by the sea. And b) several racetracks, where people would come bet on horses, which I conclude – without making any value judgments – explains the nearby presence of many wild saloons. And in the early days of Coney Island, variety performers would entertain in these two kinds of venues: the very genteel hotels and the very wild saloons.
So stay tuned!

She stood there frozen in her little black hipster outfit, 500 dollar skinny black jeans and 500 dollar haircut caught stealing fruit from an old lady and not sure what to do or what was about to happen to her. I took the opportunity to continued on with my speech. "Those lemons belong to a little old lady. She planted that tree and comes out every morning to pick one to use in her tea. She gives them to her grandchildren and neighbors as gifts. And now you are breaking off half the tree so you can have some of her lemons. I am pretty sure she did not plant that tree for you to walk by today and fuck it up. What's the MATTER with you?"

It lulls a bit in the third act, so to speak. The death of Phil Davies more or less made me want to put the book down and be down with it. Not all of the characters are winners, either. Of particular disappointment to me were the hero and heroine of the book. John Chandagnac, who becomes the pirate Jack Shandy, is a French puppeteer heading to the Caribbean to confront the uncle who stole his birthright. A nice enough back story, but the execution of the character is lackluster and he seems like just another wooden hero, not unlike the marionettes he uses in his trade. Even his use of his puppeteer skills and his rise to a position of leadership and heroic piracy are too pedestrian for what is an otherwise astounding setting. His revenge quest, which shifts to become a lover's quest, has perhaps the most uninteresting ending I've read in a long, long time. This is a shame, since had Powers not set up such a great story idea so rich with fantasy it would have been a great ending.

First off, the weight measurements for the recipes are off in the first printing of this book. I usually weigh my ingredients thought that the measurements looked a little off but gave the book the benefit of the doubt and made the Lemon Shortbread cookies per the instructions. My cookies ended up spreading all over the baking sheet and looked nothing like the shortbread cookies from the store. Later I found out that there was errata for the book. I understand that things happen and many books have a small number of errata. However, this one seemed to have more than normal and the mistakes are big ones. I mean, if the weight measurements are off then it means that every recipe is off. If you have a first printing, please do yourself a favor and download the errata here before making anything in this book. I have been told that the next printing of the book will have this mistakes fixed and Amazon is even sending me a copy free of charge.
I have been pondering and writing down some habits I would like to work on to aid in keeping me healthy. I am a grandmother now and I am not getting any younger so I would like to establish some easy daily rituals that will keep me energized and moving throughout my day.
I spoke to a company in East Acton called FX Rentals who specialise in this sort of work (they were recently given the task of transferring a newly discovered Beatles acetate). They told me they would bake the tapes for a day or two, and then play them to see what (if anything) was on them. Retrieval of any music would be £50 per hour (per hour of music, not per hour of work... it could take them many hours to restore an hours worth of music, but it will still only cost £50).

On the 20th April 1653, Cromwell dismissed the Rump Parliament and locked the doors of the Commons. Before doing so, he angrily berated the MPs, marching up and down the chamber in a bate. The apocryphal report of his diatribe, written some good 70 years later, goes like this:
The thing most people don’t understand is just how much the chaotic environment can degrade network speed. For people who care to test their cellular network, downlink speeds of 1 to 3 Mbps appear reasonable if somewhat disappointing. After all, that’s only 10-30% of the capability of a 3G network. Unfortunately, the reality is that a combination of factors can combine to degrade network performance to speeds closer to 1-3% of the capability. Interference and noise introduce errors, which in turn force the network to use less efficient modulation schemes and can drastically reduce the network speed. An accurate test of network speed will reflect this reality.
However, the book is really written for younger children than the Laura audience. Betsy and Tacy and five and have bossy older sisters who are seven. The two help each other through difficulties, such as the death of Tacy’s baby sister and fears on the first day of school, but they also make a new friend by the end of the book through their adventuresome play. It’s a heartwarming book and the first in a series, so we may need to find out what else Mrs. Lovelace has written. I know there are societies in her memory and that she based the books off of her own childhood experiences, something I am always a sucker for since sitting at my grandmother’s knee and finding her own childhood escapades to be captivating.
A lot of people are fuming over spoilers released on the internet, but in reality, most of the “leaked” information is common knowledge to anyone who has seen the prerequisite films (and I do recommend that you see these films before watching the Avengers, as the film makes many references back to circumstances in those movies and not seeing them could leave you a little lost). If you have not seen these films, Avengers does make a a few spoken mentions of the important details, but if you’re not paying attention, well then it just sucks to be you. Moving on, the film begins with the appearance of the norse god Loki (Tom Hiddleson) at S.H.E.I.L.D. headquarters where he manages to steal a mystical cube of infinite power. Terrified at the possible outcome of this situation, Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) contacts the world’s greatest special people including S.H.E.I.L.D. agents Black Widow (Scarlette Johannson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Genius billionaire playboy philanthropist Tony Stark aka Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Genetic physicist Bruce banner aka The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Recently defrosted World War 2 super soldier steve Rogers aka Captain America(Chris Evens) and Norse god of thunder Thor (Chris Hemsworth). The group has issues with agreeing on methods, means, or even personalities, but as Loki’s army marches on Earth, they have very little time to find a way to work together and stop him.

And they’ve got a couple of features which are just begging for on-line development.

Little did I know that with all the good things organic comes with, as far as no pesticides go, comes little baby spiders I have been nourishing to life.

When Jill asked us to raise Katie in her absence, Jenny and I didn't need to think it over. We looked at each other and we just knew that there was no other choice. We had known Katie since the day she was born, and she was already like an extension of our family. Jill told us there was nobody else in the world she would trust to give Katie the kind of love she deserved; the kind of love she would need to survive her loss. You can't fix a heart that's broken like that. You just have to be there and let her live through it, and let her know that you're there and that she'll always be safe and loved. One of the hardest things in the world is to watch a child you love suffer through something you can't fix, and we were terrified that we wouldn't be able to do it.

We have never experienced white racism as a couple, only intolerance from blacks. All of our friends comment about how annoying it is that we still like each other so much, and that our children are so well adjusted and sociable. We still have date night on Tuesdays and leave the kids on our anniversary to travel to a far off place. My mother-in-law teases that we are always talking about each other fondly and she makes fun of us. But she still denounces our marriage. I don’t blame her. She wants her grandchildren to look like her. I have realized that that is normal for everyone.

This dress was from George at Asda and I bought it in my normal size which is a 20 but its pretty huge on me so I have to awkwardly tuck it in but I love it all the same. I have a bit of an obsession with polka dots and this has two different sizes on so its a winner in my book! Leggings are the usual Matalan and my shoes are Primark wide fit I've gone through two pairs of these now but I love them so much and they obviously match everything! My scarf is vintage from a charity shop which I wore to just tie in the beigey colours with my jacket. I just thought I'd also add a very much wind and rain swept picture of my face into the post because I virtually went make up free today bar maybe some powder to de-shine myself slightly.
Enter the Punky Monkey, created by Joaquin Simo of New York’s Death & Company, to shake me out of our cocktail doldrums. Jeff Berry laid out the drink in his Beachbum Berry Remixed. At the bar, Berry reports that it’s on the menu as the Kerala. Regardless of the name, it’s a great little cocktail that relies on not just bourbon, but — in an uncommon and, in some quarters, controversial move — bourbon and rum in the same glass.

You may start out with a goal and a plan for your community. Things may change as your community members evolve their relationships. However, members determine how the conversation and the community develop and grow, or die. Since one of the main principles of community is that the community is in charge, you may need to hold the reins very loosely. Remember, a mob is also a type of community. Online, passions can spike instantly, and people have the tools to express themselves immediately. See a good example of what can happen on the influential Techcrunch blog.[5] Co-Founder Michael Arrington provoked an angry response when he questioned a journalist on a video blog, resulting in a mob of angry people wishing him ill on the social site FriendFeed.Depending on your community, and how it evolves, you may need to worry about mob rule. Anonymous blog commenting is one of the ways social media can get out of control. We classify the people who comment on a blog post as a form of community, although others disagree. The posters often comment on each others’ posts, and things can get out of hand and way off topic. What is your responsibility in this case? If you are too heavy-handed in ensuring posts are on-topic and polite, users can revolt, or simply leave.
It wasn't long before Constantijn was promoted to the next level in the New World Order hierarchy. Earlier this year, the young prince was appointed senior advisor to the private office of European Commissioner for the Digital Agenda, Ms Neelie Kroes.
He excuses himself to go to the restroom to defecate. He uses toilet paper to wipe his beautiful natural rectum. He understands that God created him naked. And God said that it was good. If he smells he smells what can he say? It is how God made him. He dismisses the notion that sin is in the world. He discards any thought that perhaps his nakedness is not what God wills for him.
Instead, Jesus counsels to sit in the lowest place. That way, the host will come along and say “Friend, go up higher”. So instead of shame, brought about trying to sit in the best place, you will receive glory among those who sit at the table with you.
“…hoarding all the valuables they could find,” Rucks says, referring to the fragments of the old world – also your currency – and fruit, just like the Kid.

Good beer is something that needs to be savoured. There is something about the pace of modern life generally (or maybe it's my life in particular) that is somehow not conducive to really stopping and enjoying a beer. Either there are pressures of life intruding into a special beer moment, or, and perhaps this is a crueller irony, there is so much great beer available that you feel hurried to drink what you have in front of you so you can move on to the next rarity.
Peeling leeches the size of pencils off my legs was nothing compared to this, he thought. Time for it to be over. In his line of work, booze made for bad business.

In addition--and this seemed a bit mean to me, but I did it because the errant monk recommends it--I stopped stepping over him when he was lying in my way, and instead made him get up, every single time. According to the monk, stepping over a dog is not a big deal to us, but it is full of significance to the dog: it tells him that we consider him superior. I would not have adopted this so readily had it not been that every German Shepherd we have ever owned has adored my husband, who has neither fed nor played with nor trained them, but who has always made them get up when they were in his way.

Listed below are ten unhelpful (and borderline hateful) things people usually say to those of us struggling with infertility. I personally have heard each and every one of these. I have also included what I wanted to respond with and what I actually said.
I first heard the name John Demjanjuk in 1985 when Israel sought his extradition as a war criminal. Survivors of the Nazi holocaust had recognized Demjanjuk as Ivan the Terrible, an infamous prison guard who acted with singular cruelty against Jewish prisoners at Sobibor and Treblinka.

‘At the eastern extremity of the Cairn Hill which forms the south-east boundary of the parish, south of Harperrig, there is a hollow slope or declivity, known by the name of the Caldstane Slap, through which pass, lies the drove road most commonly frequented by dealers in sheep and cattle between the Scotch and English markets. This road is passable also for travellers on horseback during the summer months. But, in order to obtain a more easy and direct communication, it is gratifying to learn that our southern neighbours have already formed and nearly completed this road to within a very short distance of the boundary of this parish; and it is to be hoped that the proprietors of the Calder district will find it their interest to imitate their good example, by finishing this line of road as far as this parish extends’. (Sommers, Account of the parish of Mid Calder, 4.)

I feel like I would be so much more motivated in life, if I knew that this was where I was supposed to be. Sometimes I wonder what would have been, could have been, if just one choice or one mistake had not occurred.

There is a mountain of evidence that is piling high against Lake that puts him directly in the frame of being Breivik’s English ‘mentor’ which includes factual evidence linking them both yet no action has been taken against him.
When we get saved many thoughts and realizations go on In the new birth seeds of our standing with God, who Christ is, belief, faith, surrender, repentance, Grace, and Trust. There are more and these are in no particular order. It is like a mixture and transformation into the new creation that we instantly become. We might not understand it all but we know there has been a change.
Rather than ask ourselves, "Is this wrong?" the question really should be, "How does this help me love God and/or others better?"
Most of the time, I can get it done in one shot. But if my music is too loud, my hair’s in my face, or my trench coat is restricting my arm movements, it might take a second try. Or third. Or sixth. If my PPP means I sometimes spend an additional 10 minutes touching up my parking job, at the very least I walk away knowing it’s the best-parked car on street. And no one can say otherwise.

After all that planting, CT and I went for a long walk in the sunshine. Then, we came home and enjoyed a few chapters of our newest read before jetting over to 862 for a patio picnic and an ice-cream cone run.

Cut the lime and run the inside of the lime around the rim of a tall glass. Pour some salt onto a small plate and dip the rim of the glass into the salt. Fill the glass with ice, add a pinch of salt, the juice of half of a lime, then fill with beer. You may have some beer leftover, just save that for the next Chelada you make. Quarter the other lime half and add both quarters to your drink.

The show was well run and my thanks to Don Lavin and Daniel Zazove on a very smooth show. I'm sure generally brisk sales added to the overall good vibe, but when you have that many pen guys spending the weekend together and you don't hear any grumbling, that's quite an accomplishment!
I know it has been a while since my last post, but I haven't been feeling well. Rather than me bellyaching, let's just say my MS has really kicked me in the butt.. well, actually, this time it has hit my arms. (The left is worst than ever, but the right is slowly regaining strength/sensation... praise heaven!!) I've been feeling quite useless and down as of late. You know what - disease sucks! Well, that's all together another story for another time. Luckily, I have a strong support network and I am working through this latest hurtle.

This time around consumers want to have conversations with us and "co-create." All we have to do is give them "compelling content" and get all social with them.
Wow. Exercising discipline in portion control is hard enough for myself. What about with this child who says over and over again, "Want toast?" Everything in me wants to reward his "using his words" by giving him food. Everything in me wants to make sure that he will thrive. Everything in me wants to love him by giving him food. But I know that food is actually not love. Love is love.

Living in the country: being a parent: going to the cinema. It's possible to combine any two of these activities but not, I've found, all three. Since my son was born in 2002 I've barely been to the pictures at all, except to take him to see the occasional Pixar movie. But last night he was staying with one of his friends, so Sarah and I ventured down to the Barn cinema at Dartington to watch Monsters, an ambitious low-budget sci-fi road movie by the young British director Gareth Edwards. (In my day, young British directors only did cheesy mockney gangster flicks, so whatever you think of his film you have to admit that ambitious sci-fi road movies are a step in the right direction.)

This is what Zen Buddhism speaks of in its emphasis on non-dualism – it's not about choosing one pole over the other, but in recognising that seeing the world in terms of pairs of opposites is not a helpful viewpoint, or 'skillful means': that this is a relative choice, and that looking directly into the nature of everything, perceiving the whole interconnectedness, allows us to see that these are arbitrary distinctions that we make, and that we have a choice about whether we buy into them, or whether we choose to work to bring the poles together in ourselves and thus in the world.

While Frances needs to gain a little more connection with the audience, it was the first show, and everyone is growing. While her hunky male dancers were “gyrating” with her and giving a rocky vibe with a new edge to the song choice of a Soul sultress, Wood managed to perform a Chaka Khan song that most would never be able to do with such integrity.

I have scrap lifted a many of times and this weekend my choice was one from Janna Wilson that I saw in Scrapbooks etc magazine April 2011 issue because it looked simple. It was quiet a challenge though. You have to study the layout and figure how they got things done a certain way. I like to get creative sometimes and change things up mostly because of what I have in my stash. It took longer than I had planned. I tried the flowers she made but they came out awful so I put them on a card come back tomorrow to see that. But here is my take and the next letter of the alphabet C- featuring Cosmo Crickets Lovey Dovey.
Meanwhile, Latinos attracted by affordable housing have settled in the area and now make up about 64% of the population. Latino-owned businesses have cropped up along the main corridors.

I was busy this weekend making chocolate covered chocolate eggs for all my family back on the east coast. I had 25# of chocolate wafers and run out. I did get 137 eggs done with all my families favorite fillings: Coconut, Peanut Butter, Caramel, Chocolate Truffle and Marshmallow. It was my first time making homemade marshmallow filling because I thought it would be hard to make but WOW really easy to make. When I went to mail out my six boxes of candy I made sure my favorite post office workers got some of the egg too. Here are some of the filling I did...
Hello! I am Roberta from Prairie Fairy Designs. I am a digital stamp company featuring artwork not only created by me but also my two kids, ages 9 and 12. They are featured on the site as the Fairy Princess and the Prairie Prince.I have been an artist for as long as I can remember and have always loved to create. Two years ago my sister-in-law invited me to a rubber stamp party. I laughed and said "Maybe I will buy something if I can use it to stamp on canvases.". Needless to say, I was hooked! Two years later, a lot of learning about computers, and a few setbacks with web stuff (I am so not tech savvy!) I finally accomplished my goal. We have been around since the spring and still growing.

Again, the Singer group is within their right to be present within their building. They are within their right to make their opinion known through whatever channels they choose – be it speech, whispers, or yes, song. But, they must be held to the same standard as every other group. The fact that you have allowed them to dictate the policy is profoundly sad. I request that you immediately rectify this situation, and require the same process of any organization or group, including the Solidarity Singers, both now and in the future.

I do like it picked apart, the swimsuit looks amazing on her and her skin is nice and her face is intense, and the body isnt too bad, but s a whole, I just dont like. It could just be my general dislike of Kesse, but I just dont love it.

Ashia started Abaya Collection in 2008 having started wearing the abayah at 19. Frustrated with the lack of variety and dismayed with the black styles of Abaya's being the only type available, she decided to invest in fabrics which she worked closely with her tailor on creating. Having always had a creative streak from a young age, Ashia was able to create and design innovative Abaya's which were well received from both family and friends.

It could be argued that some of these activities are no more dangerous than getting in the car in the morning and driving to work. Considering the safety measures involved in the case of something like skydiving, a quick spin in a Chevy would most likely be far more dangerous.
The American bishops, assembled in the Seventh Provincial Council of Baltimore, May 5-13, 1849, had given a favorable reply to both questions (in decrees I and II, on May 12), informing the Holy Father that the faithful in the United States were animated with a great devotion to the Immaculate Conception, and that they the bishops, would be pleased if the Holy Father declared the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception an article of faith.

Spinning worlds out of language, writers require us to attend, to read, to listen. The best writers are also those who listen, whether it be to the speech of others or to the messages they hear in the language of leaves or rocks or ocean. Patricia Lee Lewis enters that rank of skilled listeners with High Lonesome, her second book of poems. In this book, Patricia forefronts the art of listening as a dynamic act of connection.
"Michelle Obama - A Life" is not a book. It is an extended article of about 17 pages (Kindle pages, that is!), a summary of her biography, with very little new information, even for me, who, here in Germany, has not seen or read that much about Mrs. Obama in the news on TV or in papers and magazines.

But that's an organizational decision.
Back in the 1960s we did not use the term ethnic cleansing. We used terms such as “resettlement”, “relocation”, “blackspot removals”, “forced removals”. The term ethnic cleansing came into use in English during the Wars of the Yugoslav Succession in the 1990s, but it accurately describes what was going on in South Africa between 1950 and 1990, so I have used it in this article. The definition of ethnic cleansing is “the planned deliberate removal from a specific territory, persons of a particular ethnic group, by force or intimidation, in order to render that area ethnically homogenous.”[6]
Leaving, for me, was one of the most difficult things I have ever had to do. And I say “had to do”, because I have this very well honed sense of self-preservation. I no longer felt safe in SA. I didn’t like living in a prison called home. The hijackings of cyclists really put me off. Erratic bills from the Joburg City Council and zero recourse (I had to pay R32 000 for a “clearance certificate” on selling the house, promised a refund, nothing six months on), we’ve been victims of crime too many times, crumbling roads, deteriorating water quality (we used to wakeboard on the Vaal river – no more), absurd police force, even more outrageous and absurd “government”. You know all the reasons; having experienced them in person, and increasingly understanding that there was a gaping chasm in my personal moral and ethical makeup and that of South African society, it was clear that getting out was the only option.

There was someone by the door selling copies of his book. After some quick research I learned that Chris was there because of his last book, The Fire Ascending. (#7 of a series about dragons and the like). Turns out it was the last book in the series. and getting it now was getting it 7 days early before everyone else.
On the positive side: I visited some rental spots in the morning before I had to be at the office, and even though I had to deal with the Weirdest Cabbie I’ve Ever Encountered (and I’ve taken I lot of cabs in my time, my friends) – I found a townhouse for us when we move. We’re renting for the first year or so, to get the lay of the land before we settle anywhere, and this place is perfect. On the west side, only about 15 minutes from work, with a Urgent Care clinic and grocery store and other shopping nearby (hellloooooooo, a Brennan’s Market, just down the street). So anyway, I think we’ll like it there. I hope.
So you think they are buying time. But for what?
Actually the exposure of this bit was for me stretching of incredulity just a little too far when initially revealed but then I quickly did see the point of it. Also the book doesn't successfully end - this is because it is part one in a trilogy but I still feel there could have been a better wrap up of some of the hanging threads but then I suppose there'd be less incentive to buy the next volume.

In Episode 9 we get reviews for Angry Birds Space and Fibble: Flick ‘n’ Roll and Kinect Rush: A Disney Pixar Adventure, while in Episode 10 we get reviews for PokePark 2: Wonders Beyond and Kinect Star Wars. You may be wondering about where the Kid Icarus: Uprising review is, but if you watch Episode 9, then you’ll see that one of the questions in the Ask Good Game segment is if they’ll be doing a Kid Icarus: Uprising review and Bajo says that they’ll be doing one in Episode 11, so next time! Speaking of Kid Icarus, I’ve finished the game and will be writing a review on it the moment I get a chance, infact, if I do it before the end of week then I would’ve published a review on it before Good Game: SP! That’d be cool, but I can’t guarantee, that’s just what I’m aiming to do…

So after taking a long uncharacteristic hiatus, they finally released Human Hearts. While the other albums were important stepping stones of self-discovery, I think this record is the pinnacle of what they’ve been moving towards… and it only took a 4 year break. "Annihilation Eyes" may be the best song they've ever recorded and this record is more balanced between upbeat and slower songs than in the past and the result is probably their best work yet…
Rape, especially over the past half-century since it became a war crime, is a problematic issue in any novel that contains it, but even more when the rape of a (male) child is involved. Several reviews of Arslan focus on the shock and discomfort found when encountering the rape of Hunt Morgan in the opening chapter of the book. Since Hunt's complex relationship with Arslan forms an integral part of the novel, perhaps it is best to explore the ways in which this rape is used. Engh certainly does not sensationalize, nor does she dismiss with a cavalier attitude, Hunt's rape. Rather, his rape becomes a concrete metaphor that works on several levels: the representation of the plight of youth of both sexes in war-torn areas (the fact that the US hasn't suffered this since the end of the Civil War is harped upon in passages like the one quoted at the beginning of this review); the degradation of power relationships along the lines of imperialist resource/people exploitation (here shown in reverse); the terrorization that is unleashed on District 3281 in the immediate aftermath of Arslan's triumphant entry into the city. This does not diminish the reactions engendered by Arslan's rape of Hunt, but it does serve to provide a context in which Hunt's later actions can be seen as much more than a sickening case of sympathy for one's own tormenter.
Rochita: For many writers coming from colonized nations, the act of putting words on paper is fraught with certain matters. In this, I speak from my own experience of Filipino literature, how it was taught to me and how I absorbed what Filipino literature means to the Filipino.
At the last work group meeting, the City Administrator said that they will have another meeting of the work group prior to the May 16th City Council meeting where the CAO is supposed to report the results of the work group. As of this writing, no meeting of the work group is scheduled. Realistically, no prosecutions can take place until the City has developed a clear plan for implementation and a means of enforcement.

The Daleks are the most feared race of creatures in the entire universe and will stop at nothing to achieve their goal of total intergalactic domination. And they've concocted more than a few audacious schemes to achieve this aim – not all of which, it has to be said, have been entirely successful. JONATHAN MORRIS unearths the Daleks' own assessment of their successes and failures.
I had a really wonderful day and more than being on the river really appreciated the chance to share something nice with my friends, free from modern distractions (we all though it best to leave our phones in the cars!). We laughed more than I have for a long time as we got stuck in mud, nearly lost the person punting to low hanging trees and getting the pole stuck we drifted away from it, and of course, low bridges.
I forgave all the people that I was angry with from my past and let go of that toxic waste.

No. No, it was none of those things. It was that my boss had seen me doing a massive project that hadn't been assigned to me. The person it had been assigned to is, excuse me, out of her league on this one. And I could do it. It was giving me a headache and making me hate life, but I could do it faster than anyone else I could think of. And I didn't mind doing it.
This time in baking, we will feature bread and it can be simple bread loaf to complicated stuff. All your choice. Again it need not always be only the western breads in mind. You can always bake a naan in oven. Just an option. But only breads baked in oven are eligible.

And although Cuba suffered greatly after the collapse of its biggest ally, the Soviet Union, today the country has a 99.8% literacy rate, an infant death rate lower than most developed countries, and is the only nation in the world that has met the World Wildlife Fund’s definition of sustainable development. Having said that, Cuba is also claimed by the Human Rights Watch to have repressed nearly all forms of political dissent, and it has the second-highest number of imprisoned journalists of any nation in the world, bested only by China.

My bullying happened before the days of anti-bullying education, a topic that comes up so much in today’s middle school classroom that my eighth-grade daughter says she is sick of hearing about it. Back then, if you were bullied could muster up enough courage to tell a teacher or school administrator about it, you were basically told to ignore the bully. Don’t be a snitch. Stand up for yourself, and eventually, they will go away.

That’s the critical point right there. This is where I always have to make a decision. I either go through the pain and see what it has to tell me, or I do not. Option #1 is, as said, painful, but certainly the better one.

In the months since the Lehman debacle, the U.S. has no more lost its ability to grow and innovate than reality-TV producers have lost their ability to coax skanky behavior out of New Jersey’s youth. And despite all the headwinds, there’s no reason the expansion that started in July 2009 can’t go on as long as the previous three, which lasted 73 months, 120 months, and 92 months, respectively. When the definitive history of this period is written, it is possible—no, likely—that this post-bust era will go down not as a time of economic decline, but as one of regeneration."
Anyway. I took my new phone for a run and took this photo of a billboard on the side of a building that used to be the headquarters of the NY Post. Now it is a self storage warehouse. Do you think Rupert Murdoch wants to buy the building back?
The so-called “survival seminars” offered by Bobby Joe Fanin and his pet bovine are not just some soldier-of-fortune-style of ripping the stupid off for a few bucks, but are a ruse to draw in the unwitting and stupid into a Luciferian rite to honor Loki, with seminar attendees offered up as a sacrifice to their dark lord.
But Boykin refused to hold a photo of Tony up in front of herself for the newspaper, insisting she not appear in the publication. Her kids likewise refused. I asked, before I left, if they had any anecdotes about the departed they wanted to share, something that illustrated the kind of man he was.

It was clear from day one that the Anglo-American empire, along with its clients like Qatar, were actively supporting and planning to bring destablization to the country. From the very first days of the civil war in Janurary 2011, before the shell casings had even hit the ground, western envoys and consultants worked with known al-Qaida fighters and criminals in Libya to form a new NTC government, a new central bank and a new state oil holding company. NATO were deployed to give brutal air support to these new gangs of rebel paramilitaries, and for nearly 10 months, both those groups killed, tortured, raped and looted everything in their path.
I’m trying to herd the cats for the Bridger Wilderness. I think – think – we’ll end up with about 5 or 6.

I just recently learned about Search Engine Optimization or SEO. I didn’t see the big deal. Then I read some articles. I realized what a huge deal it actually is not only for journalists, but also for pretty much anyone who is trying to get recognition through the Internet. It’s hard enough for journalists to get their work noticed and read, but to have to fight with SEO presents another roadblock. The question comes up whether journalists should be focused on writing the best story or writing it to cater to SEO.
Just last summer we went with friends on their boat through this same canal. The weather then couldn’t have been more different compared to the weather yesterday. As soon as we parked the car it started snowing. I wrapped my camera in plastic and we walked to the A-bridge to take some shots of the people on the ice, the boats in the ice and the beautiful houses along the canal.

I often tell my son (and mean it) that he can be absolutely anything he wants. He can do anything if he is prepared to work hard. To sacrifice and go after his goal with a passion. He wants to be a footballer. He could be. But he will have to spend hours every day practicing when his friends are out on the town. He ‘can’ do it. But will he? I don’t know. He ‘can’ be an astronaut. He will have to work really hard at those Science subjects he’s not too keen on and do lots of extra years as a poor student when his mates are earning good money. He ‘can’ do it. Will he?
Today, after the blood draw and doctor appointment, we went for a walk. We got new chairs for the back yard, a mister that goes with you (keep you cool on the go) and a grill basket. We are excited that summer is here! My MS has been laying low, and I am loving it!

It really was a fun morning. We opened gifts, had breakfast, played with our new toys and I even learned how to knit! We always talk about the gifts we open, but we all know that the holiday is more than that. It's the gift of family and memories and joy and celebration. Toss in a little silliness and a lot of food and you have some of the best days of all. If you only get to see each other a few times a year you have to make the most of those few days.

Without unresolved action as a device, what can a picture book author do to make sure that a sequel is more than a thinly veiled rehashing of the first book? I decided to deal with this challenge by putting my protagonist in a more outrageous situation in the second book.

And there are many other means of assassination. The Soviet KGB could not assassinate Sakharov's reputation, it was above reproach. But in the modern era, with the elite media serving as the Obama regime's willing propaganda organ (birth control, anyone?) this is easier to arrange than ever. Popular media icons can be and have been driven off the airwaves by the full-court press of the Media Matters smear machine, in coordination with Valerie Jarrett at the Whitehouse War Room. And does anyone believe that the vicious smear campaign against black conservative Republican candidate Herman Caine was not orchestrated in the War Room of Gangster Government, Inc?
Whether I broke up with a man for horrible reasons, or the fact it just didn’t work, I’ve taught myself to remember that there was a reason I loved him. Just because the worst of my exes showed another more negative side I didn’t expect or vice versa, it would be a lie to all of a sudden act like I’m repulsed by their existence on the planet.
But so far my home is back in Korea, and I often think about my return. Maybe if I study more Korean I can make daily chit-chat with the folks out there. We'll see...for now I've got Florida.

This past month, Logan has continued to grow so much in the vocabulary department. In fact during our visit to Oregon this past weekend, I swear he learned 10 more words!! He regularly talks about Elmo and his favorite Sesame Street friends, and is also verbalizing his favorite foods "peas", "blues (berries)", "Cheese", "wa wa" and lets us know when he has finished by saying 'ah duh"... he also has picked up a couple other phrases such as "Happy Bees" (a favorite song in our house), and 'bye mama" and "I Of You!". And the best of all, over the past week he has begun searching for one of us saying "mama, are you?" His little voice is just so darn sweet and most of all, I LOVE LOVE LOVE how he has an ear to ear smile when he knows he is being heard and understood. It feels that all we are doing is clapping and praising.... just as it should be in raising little ones!!
And, with a sudden sense of panic, I know I have to get busy.

You’ve got to start somewhere, so follow the path of societal acceptance for depraved behavior the way the left has ALWAYS done it before: demand that they be viewed as “human just like everyone else” and demand that they be accorded rights and respect. THEN you later demand that since they’re decent, respectable people their vile behavior can’t be viewed as vile anymore. It’s been part of their playbook over and over again and it worked which is why America and Western Europe is so astonishingly morally-velocitized with behavior that was utterly unacceptable just a generation ago being openly celebrated now. So let’s “Play it again, Sam” with pedophiles.
And there, right there, I think I fulfilled another one of the requirements:
There is a lot we know about this photo. I know I read about it in one of the volumes of letters (I'm guessing 74) and PKD talks about the event as well as this young woman at some length. Why I bet someone out there in the aether could find that information lickity split, and they would forever earn my (and all of our) respect as a serious Dick-head, because all of my volumes of letters are in my office, and I'm not. If you could just put that info right in the comments section that would be great.

Flavia was attracted to Brunel Business School owing to the excellent reputation of the Business School and the high ranking of the MBA programme. She hopes the course will help her to achieve her aspirations for the future. ‘I am thrilled about my MBA studies. Having started the programme in September 2011, I feel my horizons are already broadening and I see there are many new opportunities I can think about for my future. It seems like it will open doors to possibilities that I hadn’t considered before.”
Keaton's projectionist eventually manages to slip into this cinema dream world, inhabiting the role of the detective, fending off the sinister maneuvers of the crooks who concoct endless death traps that he flawlessly slips around, always intuiting their evil intentions before they can spring the trap. In the movies, the hero always wins, the bad guys always fail, and one senses that this young projectionist, like so many others, was first seized by his desire to be a detective while watching screen detectives much like this one. He inhabits an archetypal role, taking on a character type that had inspired him to try to shape his real life to match the movies, to become a detective like the ones on the screen — but only in dreams or the movies can such archetypes actually exist.
Back in early September of 2007, I visited New Orleans to see how the city was doing two years after Hurricane Katrina. One of the restaurants I visited was Parasol’s, an old Irish bar known for a legendary Roast Beef Po’Boy sandwich.
It is certainly the largest second-hand bookshop I have ever visited and they are constantly adding new features. There’s a room for children’s and teen books with a bookcase in the shape of a truck in the middle (with a cab you can climb into). The children’s classics (think old editions of Arthur Ransome, Angela Brazil and Anthony Buckeridge, to name but a few – some more battered than others but all of them gorgeous) are just outside the entrance to that room, alongside the classic adult fiction and crime. In the front room (with the coffee, cakes and open fire) there’s literary fiction, modern women’s fiction, historical, war-era and SF/fantasy fiction. There’s a large area for history books of various kinds with the audio books by the cashdesk. And then there’s the Big Room – row upon row of shelves of every genre you can think of (including overflow areas for some of the afore-mentioned) plus glass cases around the edge containing some of the more precious books. If you’re looking for anything from a cheap old paperback of a novel you once borrowed from a friend and would like to read again, to a first edition for a relative’s significant birthday, you can find it here. (A few years ago, for my sister’s 30th, I bought her a Twinkle annual from the year of her birth and a first edition Topsy and Tim, also published in her birth year.) The best thing about being there is that nobody cares if you just sit there lost in a book – because most of the other visitors will be doing the same! I was there with 9 members of my family today and, apart from my one-year-old niece (who was enjoying an afternoon nap), we each immediately drifted towards the section which most interested us and regrouped about an hour later clutching our various purchases! I got two suitably old-looking hardback Georgette Heyers (as a sort of post script to yesterday’s post), including one with a dust jacket in very good condition, and a much more recent Melissa Hill which was just a bit of a bargain!

On the same day as the green paper was released, the deputy minister of correctional services, Mr Ngoako Ramatlhodi, let the cat out of the bag when he said the African National Congress (ANC) had made ‘fatal concessions' at the time of the political transition (see full article here). Given the balance of forces at the time (including the collapse of the Soviet Union), it had accepted a Constitution which ‘emptied the legislature and executive of real political power' and ‘immigrated (sic) the little power left [to them] to civil society and the Judiciary'.

Cut the eggplant into large fries. The easiest way to do this is to cut the ends off the eggplant, peel it, then stand it up. Slice the eggplant length-wise into 1/2" pieces. Then lay each piece down and cut it into 1/2" strips. If you want your fries long, leave them like this. If you want them shorter, cut those strips in half.

Advertising is the means to making a great number of consumers aware of certain products. Therefore, advertising should be both attracting and appealing to consumers. If the advertising isn't appealing enough, it won't be effective. If the advertising manages to pull the attention of consumers, then it's considered to be powerful.
I like booze and I've featured that subject time and again over the decades (you can see no fewer than seven of my paintings involving sweet, sweet booze in this post about Artevino), and I expect to return to it in the near future (possibly after my next big series which is currently in pre-production).

While I am at the 2012 AWDF Championship and Team Challenge, I plan to experiment with different metering modes and see if it makes a difference. In his book, Mitchell recommends that less experienced photographers stay with evaluative mode, and I agree. Even the pros, such as Mitchell, find the evaluative mode, which is the default mode for most DSLRs, works very well. But I am curious, so check back to see the results of this experiment. If you have any experience with using different metering modes in Schutzhund or other types of photography, I would love to hear from you.

After a hearty supper, all the young people went outside to play. Since so many younger children were involved, they had to choose a simple game. The game they chose was Wolf, which caused Hannah to consider whether or not she might be too old to join in. The game involved races run at full speed in the darkness. When all of the cousins and Sam announced they would play, Hannah decided to join in. After all, Sam and she were the same age. If he could play, so could she.

one in ten Sleestaks can, in brief flashes of insight, remember the ancient secrets of their ancestors. (Roll D10 at character generation. They have this power if a 1 is rolled.) Once per session the Player can make up a detail about any dungeon environment the characters find themselves in, details may include secret doors, passwords, codes, the location of a pylon or how to operate a pylon. The DM should let the player throw their idea out there in one short sentence, but then further details are for the DM to determine. Note that ancient Sleestak technology allows for structures that are larger on the inside than the outside and other warping of time and space, so dungeon maps need not be modified except to note the location of any new Sleestak generated details. It is of course the prerogative of the DM to declare a dungeon off limits to this power because it was not built by Sleestaks or has been otherwise untouched by their weird lizardy claws.
Gladys sat in the bed with a thermometer in her mouth. Nurse Meme was in getting ready for her shift at the hospital and came in to check on her. “Temperature is normal. Is your stomach still hurting” she asked as she shook down the mercury and wiped off the cylinder with alcohol. Gladys knew that she had to play it out and replied “yes ma’am. It fills all wooshie.” Nurse Meme pulled down Gladys’ lower eye lid and looked in her eyes, and then she made Gladys breath out and in. “You know, your breathe is pretty metallic and I don’t like the look of your eyes, they are a little yellow.” Then she was gone.

This moves the ideal attack point from the forums to the mobile apps. It means that proper logging is introduced it is just as easy to see where an attack may originate, and perhaps makes the interface for doing hundreds of brute force attacks much harder, because perhaps it is harder to create a web app that simulates a mobile browser and requests the information. Maybe.

I’ve never sought out this Billy Idol song. It was on the radio in the mid-80s just as often as “Sister Christian,” and I don’t remember if I ever liked it in the first place. Though I haven’t yet seen it, the Eyes Without a Face film is much more appealing as it seems to take the possibly terrifying imagery conjured by the title more seriously. It’s a 1960 French film by Georges Franju, and you can learn more about it here.
Erie Brewing has been one that I haven't really been blown away by, mostly because their Railbender is decent enough, but I never seem to be able to get it fresh.

Pupils can use a Photo Album PowerPoint template or Ript to create digital art scrapbooks showcasing their efforts, writing little comments about their work. By the end of the session get them to decide on a favourite application and what they liked about it. So that everyone is focused on adding content to the scrapbook, add their names to the fruit machine random name generator available via Classtools – and use it to choose pupils to come up front and showcase their work – that way you can carry out some self evaluation and peer evaluation (like 2 stars and a wish) during your plenary.

All actors were undeniably good in their roles. I don’t know if they portrayed their characters spot-on based on the book, but most if not all were able to convince (and move) me with their acting. Jennifer Lawrence’s fits the role of the smart and alluring Katniss seamlessly. I could say the same for Josh Hutcherson (for Peeta), as well as the supporting cast (Woody Harrelson, Liam Hemsworth, Elizabeth Banks, Lenny Kravitz and the rest). I found Lawrence and Hutcherson’s romance believable, evoking empathy during my screening when they tended their wounds or shared a kiss.

Although we had to discover Chanti's weakness, Satan already knows ours. And he uses them against us as easily as we wave the broom at our rooster.
Newcomb Art Gallery of Tulane University, New Orleans, LA (as of 9-12). Erik Neil, director, reported that sources indicate the main structure is sound. There are roof leaks and offices may have had some flooding. The primary concern right now is the removal of the most vulnerable works on paper and textiles. The off-site storage facility is located in an area of extensive flooding, and all indications now are that works of art housed there were damaged by water.
When this radio preacher told of Ananias and Sapphira being struck dead he made it clear that Acts 7: 51-60 records that Stephen was stoned to death. James was about to be killed with the sword. Peter would be crucified upside down in Rome where Paul would have his head chopped off. Let us not forget John the Baptist who lost his life because he dared to name sin in Herod’s life. Most of all Jesus the Lord of glory was executed as a criminal.

I am interested in politics. I like to participate in my democracy. However, sometimes politics is not top priority as life takes hold. Yet the past two weeks here in Portland, Oregon and throughout the United States illustrate how life and politics are inexorably linked.

DILI, 26 March 2012 (IRIN) – A proposal to sanction the use of indigenous languages in primary schools in polyglot Timor-Leste has divided members of government, civil society and educators, raising questions about how language can spur harmony – or discord – in the young nation.
I trust everyone out there in TV land will be glued to AMC this weekend to check out episode 2 of the second season of The Walking Dead. I caught a repeat of episode one on Sunday, of course watched alone in the dark. Very intense, you have been warned.

Anne Shirley, of, "Anne Of Green Gables", once asked her best friend Diana something like, "What would you rather be, ravishingly beautiful or really smart?" I would rather be ravishingly beautiful. Even just for one day, to see what it is like. To have my husband come in from work and be SO impressed with me...and perhaps that day I would manage to get the house totally spotless...and have a wonderfully healthy and delicious dinner on the table. And the dog would be all bathed and fragrant and well-behaved. People would drop in and remark how clean the house is, and the teenagers would be proud. I, of course, would be feeling invigorated from my five mile run, accomplished with absolutely no flapping noises, since in this daydream, I am seriously thin. Too thin, so I must make up for it with a stack of oatmeal cookies. Okay, I went from Ravishingly Beautiful to Supermom to ridiculous.

And soon I am going to Lucerne to hear Andras Schiff conduct the B minor Mass and I can't wait, because his performance of the St Matthew Passion with the Philharmonia a decade or more ago was the most inspiring, exciting performance I've yet heard of this work, shining out in technicolour with all its inner conviction, passion and spirituality.
I remember a sub-plot where a dealer is trying sell a car and how he uses his convincing powers, acting, fake calls to his bosses to sell a car. At all times he is trying to show to the buyer that he is their friend but is trying to extract as much as possible from them. How dealers make more money from service, insurance as compared to sales of the car. There is information about how the cost of each part is so important. When a company finds a problem with the test drive of car and has to come up with a solution that will cost few dollars more to cost, they go into hyper-drive as each and every dollar matters to them.

And I'm taking advantage of all that not-in-pain-ness to finally take back over a lot of my job. I intended to be taking it easier than this, but on the one hand, I have to admit John is rather overwhelmed by having to do so many of the chores after a full day's work, and on the other, I have been antsing to do it. I don't really know when I got so attached to doing housework, but it just feels like MY job, that I ought to be doing. Especially since no one else does it MY way.

Place: Earth is a resource to be owned, valued by the price it will fetch in the marketplace, and exploited for maximum financial return. Our individual identity is defined by the brands we consume. Our individual worth is determined by the price we command in the marketplace and our accumulated financial assets. We maximize our personal economic efficiency by minimizing our individual connection and commitment to any place, person, or community and maximizing our readiness to move on when presented with greater financial opportunity elsewhere. Property rights are properly treated as individual, total, and freely tradable if the price is right.
I really felt much admiration for Henry. He's the leader of the whole operation and comes across as a great man, very wise, who can manage the complexities in a calmly organized way. He is the hardest working of them all and his family seems very close and sweet.
The malteser linear gear is a device to make visible the difference in sunrise between summer and winter, and also the quotient from day and night. Marc also points out that the transformation from rotation in a linear movement always has the same speed (no sine function). The malteser cross mechanism is responsible for the change of the seasons.
At one point in the top of the seventh, Haslup had struck out five Spartans in a row. He was replaced by Boyden in the eighth after seven impressive scoreless innings. Boyden continued right where Haslup left off as he continued to dominate Norfolk State batter after batter.
Now, I’m not certain if the conventionality of that plot (really, when you take the basics it’s a story we all know and have seen multiple times before) is intentional for the sake of nostalgia, but it only results in the audience waiting to see what they already know is going to happen, rendering the scenes (most of them) where the expectations are confirmed often underwhelming. And whether it’s an original way to tell the story or not, I don’t think that it being neo-silent film really helps that problem.
The diary itself is one of those '5 year' jobbies, where you fill in the year manually. I think we'd been doing Samuel Pepys at school around that time, and I'd got all buzzed up on keeping a diary. I guess I dreamt of logging the final years of the seventies, as we went head-first into a brand new decade. I imagined my musings would be studied in years to come as an invaluable historical document of how people lived back then... and with a market shop down the road doing 5 year diaries for 25p (5p a year!), what could possibly go wrong?!
Oh, and get this...he's not telling his mum or sisters that he is coming! I made some comment on facebook about his trip to Australia and he got a wee bit annoyed with me. "I told you that, Emma, that I was going to surprise them. It was the very first thing I said!" Um, no actually, it wasn't. I would remember that because I would have said "What the feck are you thinking! That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard!" Honestly! Anyway, I am pretty sure his one sister saw it, or at the very least her son said something. She called here that very night and she never, every calls us. She didn't ask and he didn't volunteer it. He was talking to the nephew on facebook the other night and he did ask William if he was coming, to which he said yes, but it was meant to be a surprise. He says he didn't tell anyone, but we are pretty sure they know!

As the sun lowers beyond the horizon, the color spectrum of the sky changes to orange, pink and red hues. Clouds, dust or airborne particles appear back lit with vibrant colors, which casts the same color filter on anything reflective (water, shiny leaves, glass, etc). Shadows lengthen during sunset, increasing the contrast between the bright sunlight fading in the sky and non-reflective or absorbing surfaces (hills, mountains, trees, buildings, etc) creating a silhouette effect.

I was on the high way, and no one appeared to be chasing me. My hands shook as I checked my camera. It was unharmed. Then I reached inside my pocket for the tape recorder. I pulled it out. It and my hand were covered in blood. My blood. Then I felt it, the pain of child birth wouldn’t compare. I searched for where the wound was and applied pressure.
They will tell you their divine forefathers came from another realm beyond the sky, crossing the gulf between worlds in a ship of immense proportion and grand design, bringing with them the people that would populate the world, and this is accurate…though perhaps not in the way the skalds imagine.
Life is full of” stuff” today. For some of us our “stuff”is a never-ending schedules of commitments and responsibilities. Other stuff may involve job loss, financial difficulties, loss of family member, serious illness personally or within our circle of family and friends. No matter what the “stuff” may be in our lives, we have a “go-to” guy. This “go-to” guy is known as Jesus Christ. He is there 24/7 to listen to our needs.

Clarification:
So, our school system’s spring break is coming up and I decided to go somewhere. This past winter really did a number on me, and I just need to get out of Dodge. I’ve always wanted to travel across Canada by train, but I don’t have much time in April. Besides, I have a sixteen year old cat that I refuse to put in a kennel and my ex would rather stick a needle in his eye than offer to check on her. So, I decided to go somewhere for three nights. That would introduce me to solo travel. Now, you have to realize that I am also a woman in my mid-fifties, so I’m not looking to meet someone. My mom told me when I was getting a divorce that “I was too old to get a divorce and I’d never find a man.” Um, thanks, Mom. Well, not looking for a man. I just want to get re-acquainted with myself. I think I will be a lot of fun.

The bride wanted a very simple and elegant one. I had to design the text layout and sent it out to be printed and then handmake the rest of the invitation to accommodate what was being printed - invitation body, orchid square, and RSVP card. It may have been a simple invitation in appearance, but my goodness, it sure took a lot of running around. A good thing I have a friend that didn't mind driving me around. We had some fun doing it. However, after making a prototype that she loved, it was then difficult to get some of the supplies!

Characters: There's quite a few. In the main party, there's five. The protagonist, Ein and his four female companions, Fia, Lina, Serene, and Cierra. They're decent characters. A bit stereotypical and anime-like, but very likable nonetheless. Ein is a bit two dimensional and seems a bit naive some of the time, but it does help you slip into the role and make your own decisions most of the time. For plot reasons, I can't go into the antagonists too much, but they're not that bad. Definitely not stock bad guys.
And after all the excitement of Elmo, i ahd the somewhat more adult excitement of being finally able to put Flynns new " big boy " room together! The garage-to-bedroom/playroom conversion was completed by the carpet layers while we were at the Elmo show, so when we got home i got busy moving him in. Aside from a lunch and a dinner break, i literally spent 7 hrs yesterday builing flatpack furniture, setting it up, and moving all the toys and books from loungeroom and old bedroom to the new one. I have to say by 8:30pm last night was completely and utterly exhausted - methinks this pregnant lady took on too much for one day! - but it was well worth to be able to put him to sleep in his cool new room and snuggle down into my own bed to watch " Revenge " in peace!

This contest started me thinking. What am I inspired by in my life on a daily basis? The first thing that came to mind was helping people by making a difference in someone’s life. Then I dug deeper. Why is this inspiring to me? Because it is fun. It is incredibly fun to see someone smile when they see that the road is brighter or they realize they too are full of potential.

It pained me to admit it, but I missed Jack and had an irrational fear of losing him to whatever end. I didn’t want this sort of emotional chaos, but it came with the territory I had entered. Had opening myself up to let Jack in been worth the internal turmoil I felt? Was there I way to avoid that turmoil without giving Jack up? I turned to Harry Lime for an answer: “Don’t be so gloomy. After all it’s not that awful. Like the fella says, in Italy for 30 years under the Borgias they had warfare, terror, murder, and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and the Renaissance. In Switzerland they had brotherly love – they had 500 years of democracy and peace, and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock.”

The information processing family focuses on how we can best acquire information, organize it and explain it. A teacher seeking to sharpen students’ basic thinking skills could employ the method of concept attainment which teaches pupils to learn and use concepts and develop and test hypotheses. This method allows for the development of critical thinking skills and when focused on abstract concepts, “the strategies nurture an awareness of alternative perspectives, a sensitivity to logical reasoning in communications, and a tolerance for ambiguity (p. 75).”

In Queensland and New South Wales the game is king – although the ‘fans’ are fickle, the crowds parochial and small and the game run by old men with too much self interest and not nearly enough forethought – and they are very protective of their patch. In Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, Northern Territory and Tasmania the AFL rules. To the point where a parade of the Grand Final teams on the Friday before the game in Melbourne attracted over 100,000 people – that’s something like 5 times the number of fans who turned up to the NRL Preliminary final in Sydney the following night.
In my determination to change my mindset and to find joy and happiness again, I lost much. I lost myself. I lost parts of me that I had identified with for so long and parts I loved. I lost several close friends that I had before the mugging. The new me was not to their liking and even though they said they would always be there for me, when things got tough, they rather coldly and brutally walked out. My children suffered and so did my marriage. My family and friends needed to protect me and I needed them not to.
So here I am painting the very plant in the very Himalayan village Miss North painted over a century ago, and I'd like to think there's a sort of kinship in that. And thinking of her painting the whipcord cobra lily in particular makes me smile; it must have been the most amusing affront to Victorian sensibilities to behold a plant with such an overpowering eau de offal* and that unseemly, ridiculously long spadix. See her painting here.

Did Jesus go to hell? This has been a controversial question over the years, and there are many people who teach that his spirit descended into hell after his death, either to proclaim judgment to sinners or to rescue the saints of the Old Testament. There is also a heretical group that teaches that the cross wasn’t enough, so he he also had to suffer in hell for three days. I don’t have time to get into all the problems with THAT idea!

It could be painting, sculpture, digital arts or others.

I do exactly the same for every single line of action and dialogue in scripts. Briefer is better. I’m also quite particular about how my scripts look - I strive for them to be as clean and readable as possible - and so I hate ‘widows’ (a single line at the end of a sentence, containing only one word) cropping up. Widows must die. Kill your widows. Hack at that script/tweet until it says what needs to say, in as concise a manner as possible. It’s amazing how much a seemingly splendid line can be improved by boiling it down or completely rephrasing. Thinking about it, it’s probably not a terrible rule of thumb to impose 140-character limits on your script action lines.

The police are appealing for witnesses. They say the car involved was an old-style silver Peugeot 406 estate.

I don't have to tell you what it was: by now I'm sure you can all see from the photos. At this point, a review would also be rather pointless since you know that I love it, but let me profess my adoration for one more paragraph. Inspired by the Garden of Ninfa in Italy, Annick Goutal's Ninfeo Mio consists of notes of Italian lemon, citron, pettigrain, bitter orange, galbanum, lentisque, fig leaf and lemon tree wood and is an olofactory interpretation of the mythic Garden of Hesperides. Given that I'd been convinced I disliked citrus and felt quite snobbish about fruit, it seems an unlikely choice - but Lord, is this a beauty. At first sharp, bracing, cool, green and bitter, it settles into a wonderfully dry, dusty but creamy warmth on the skin. A lot of the time, fig smells very much like blackcurrant to me, one of the fruits of my childhood; and beyond that, Ninfeo Mio feels like The Secret Garden out of the Frances Hodgson Burnett novel, which is one of my all-time favorite books. So there it is: an embodiment of something out of my past and something out of my dreams.
Me “Yeah…”
Finally, while there is no record of a response by government forces to Renwick’s preaching at Woolf-hole-craig’, they did respond to the Cairnhill preaching. In July 1684, the authorities do not appear to have captured have any prisoners from the Cairnhill or Cauldstane Slap preachings and did not know which minister or ministers had preached at them. It is possible that the government response produced further information on location of the preachings and the identify of the preacher. That may explain why the proclamation of 20 September recorded that Renwick was the preacher at the Woolf-hole-craig conventicle.

This lack of communication between my mouth and my brain has been with me a long time now. I’m a survivor of an all girls boarding school. So I speak from experience when I say that girls should never be cloistered in the hills of Pennsylvania, USA, with nothing but a farm and nuns; they’ll get bored. And nothing is worse than a pack of bored, adolescent girls when rules are expected to be followed. My personal favorite was smoking. This was the seventies and it didn’t make folks the pariah it does now. In fact, it was still “cool” then. Anyway, I’d promised the principal, Sr. Rose, that I’d not smoke on campus anymore. Needless to say, I was caught not two weeks later. When she asked me what had happened to my promise I replied, “I guess it went up in smoke.” Yea, I know you could probably see that one coming, but, if it makes you feel any better, I swear my left ear still hurts from her tugging on it the whole way to her office.
It’s kind of juvenile (“take that, I’m NOT going to eat that cookie, so there!”) but when we’re angry and sad, don’t we kind of regress to those primitive childlike emotions? So if I respond like a child (saying, although not directly to them, “No, you can’t make me eat a bunch of junk food! No, you can’t make me resort to alcohol just to numb the pain you caused!”) isn’t that OK? If I feel like by NOT giving in to emotional eating, I’m “winning” by being good to myself, and it helps, then I think it’s a valid thing to do.

My heart I can’t stop Break Down
and as the blog title suggests, you can't take it back.
Now I remember telling you months ago, blushing furiously, that I didn't really have any shame about watching most porn, probably because most of what I watch is pretty "normal." Hardcore, definitely, but nothing all that extreme. But there is one thing I sometimes watch but had never admitted to anyone because it just seemed, well, wrong to be excited by. "It's, um," couldn't even look you in the face when I told you, "this Japanese porn where the girl's getting sort of manhandled by a group of guys." I swallowed, cleared my throat. (Why was I even telling you this? It's not like you had to know every single one of my fantasies, after all. But for some reason I was fessing up.) "It's always public places, mostly on trains. And there are just all these hands, and a lot of groping, and kind of fingers coming from all directions and stuff." I was aware that I was getting wet, but I wasn't sure if it was the fantasies themselves or the fact that I was revealing myself to you that was making me more worked up. "And, I don't know. She pushes the guys off at first, but then she's outnumbered, she can't stop them or get away and they finger her and shove their cocks into her mouth and fuck her, right there on the train car. And she makes a show of resisting, which, you know, is part of why I find it kind of disturbing, but it's also pretty obvious that she's coming by the end, and, I don't know…they turn me on," I finished sheepishly. And you had very casually said you'd have to check them out sometime and that was the last we ever said about it.
Since I’d been tested and had a rabid reading habit of my own that allowed me to devour books in a very short time, I was very advanced for being only 5 years old. The school even said that if I’d had a better grasp of mathematics that they would have considered having me skip Kindergarten and perhaps even 1st grade because I was already reading on a 3rd grade level. But, my poor math skills kept me back and I hated the first day of Kindergarten because it was nothing but recess all day. I was there to learn, by god, and all the playing was SO boring! And I couldn’t get over the other classmates who would cry and whine and need to be restrained as their parents left each day! Didn’t they realize that this was where you could learn more and be away from your parents and be who you wanted to be?

Last night at work was one of my all time worst nights. I know I say that almost every week but I mean it this time. It made me think that it would be a good idea to give the jackasses out there that have no idea of how to act in a restaurant some hints.

She's always been really positive but her time in hospital really showed me just how much. No matter how much the nurses pricked and probed her with needles, got her up walking when she was weak, or woke her during the night to take blood pressure - she never once complained. Instead she thanked them, told them "I don't know how you keep going working such long hours" and that they were great!
Night of Navy Satin Ribbon
Sigh!
We have had a week let me tell you! My sweet Juliana has been sick since Tuesday with a high fever and what that Doctor first thought to be a bladder infection. When I say high fever I mean high 103 and I could not get it below 101. Thursday night she was so sick I had thought about just going to the E.R. We made it through the night and to the Doctor on Friday. She was in so much pain she would not let me touch her. As soon as the Doctor saw her he told me she needed to be admitted. The bladder infection turned to out to be a kidney infection. It is so hard when your husband is away, you have two kids in school, are planning to have a garage sale the next morning, your daughter is having friends over to spend the night and then you are told you need to take your daughter to the hospital 30 minutes away!! I do not know what I would have done without a cell phone, the ability to text and a group of friends who jumped in and helped with the kids on Friday after school. The garage sale and sleepover did not happen and my daughter was not happy about that. I think I reached my text limit with her trying to explain why the sleepover and garage sale would not happen while sitting outside the ultrasound room waiting for Juliana to come out.
Also in advance, I’m going to say: thank you, Dad, for forcing me to think through every single inclusion of a wacky gizmo or goop. I don’t want someone to be immersed in reading my book and then, poof, one completely out-of-place piece of implausible science throws them back out. Having my dad’s opinion in the back of my head has already kept me from what could have been some very obvious errors. Weird and unlikely, yes. Outright contradicting the laws of physics? No, thank you.

The sarcastic voice
And the accusers that stand silenced before the Almighty Father include the voices of the restless conscience. In his first epistle St John says, “Whenever our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and he knows everything.” So whenever we reproach ourselves — for our unkindness, our short temper, our foolishness and cowardliness and laziness, for not being better parents, better spouses, better friends, better at our jobs, for not making more progress in our arts, hobbies and fields of study, for not being richer or fitter or more powerful or better-looking — John tells us that God sees all this far more clearly and extensively than we do. And that when our misfiring conscience just won’t shut up, God, who is greater than our conscience, can silence it. The question “can I forgive myself?” can be an agonizing one. But its importance, so overblown when we install ourselves as judges in a cramped hell of our own making, vanishes like mist before the rising sun when we place ourselves in the dock before the Judge of all. For He is both more severe and infinitely kinder with us than we are with ourselves.

Oh. My! This Cookies and Cream Frosting is absolutely amazing! My daughter wanted vanilla frosting on her cup cakes for her birthday party, but when I walked past a lovey package of Oreos at the store, the wheels in my head started spinning. The result of the spinning wheels in my head isn't always good. I guess I got lucky this time. :)
Peace is not just when the war is over and the armies are demobilized. Peace is the condition of being secure in one's property and person, of being able to perform one's routine activities without fear of violence. The last century and a half has allowed us to forget how rare and precious real peace is. The typical condition of mankind before the nineteenth century was to live in brutality and fear. Men had to be armed and eternally vigilant to attain peace; slaves, serfs, and women could not hope for it without the protection of a rough man ready to do violence on their behalf.
I thought I was the only one who sees the “NEW BLACK PANTHER PARTY” as nothing more than a bunch of a F.E.D.S trying to get gullible people to react violently. The Huey P. Newton Foundation (of the ORIGINAL PANTHERS) are denouncing them!!! All of these racist hate groups have agents infiltrating their organizations. The Neo Nazi skinheads are notorious for it (IE: HAL TURNER, TIM MCVEIGH & ETC). Only a sucker would fall for the oke-doke. The panthers and other REAL positive black movements were destroyed by Gay Edgar Hoover & Co-intel-pro. Even sellout blacks were used by the feds to infiltrate and destroy the movement. Don’t think for 1 second that this agenda has ended. Here’s another great article exposing the neo nazis and the new black panthers.

Today was a great sunday! Brother Seamon gave a talk that was really cool about how to get through hard times here were his suggestions on how to better get through hard times
The twelve disciples were called the 12 apostles. Their primary job was to bear “witness to his resurrection” (Act 1:22). Jesus selected his disciples very early on so they could bear witness from the beginning of his ministry to his resurrection. When they replaced Judas, Peter laid this criteria for apostleship:
With a straight face, he handed the ticket to the man behind the counter.

And here is what I believe Barnes may have been after: a visage; a physiognomy made from symbolic decorative arts items, suggestively arranged to resemble a face. Normally this consists of candlesticks for eyes, and vessels for a mouth (and occasionally a nose and mouth). Thus, the concept of the omnipresence of art at the Barnes Foundation (or a pervasive mirror, if you will). Essentially, Barnes was creating the suggestion of a face on the very surface which a centralized viewer would be standing in front of. And the items vary according to which direction the symbolic connection is to go. For example, in Gallery 6 on the south wall, (see image above) a teapot is placed: it both formally references the reflection on the lake in the Gauguin painting above it, as well as symbolizes a carrying and possible pouring out (or divvying out) of of knowledge, wisdom -- or potency. Conversely, in Gallery 2, east wall, the central vessel (mouth, if you will) is a host box for holding the symbol of Christ's body for communion...of course, it references the painting above, a depiction of a vision of the Holy Virgin, by El Greco. But it also symbolizes the emptiness (which it is) of a soul waiting and imploring for the holiness of God to fill them - it is a vessel in waiting; in limbo; in anticipation, along with the saint seen in prayer receiving a vision.
As you prepare your home for an open house, you should make the decor as tasteful and unassuming as possible. A conservative buyer might be offended by any liberal books or items you have on display. Bear in mind that your goal is to create a more universal type of appeal. Try to make it broadly appealing, instead of narrowly focused on those just like yourself.
If your neighborhood is under the rule of terror by a gang like Flint’s Howard Boys, and you do the right thing, and kill one or two or more, you would get either life in prison or the death penalty. And if you’re white, any prison time for killing blacks equates to the death penalty. Either you’ll get gang-raped, tortured, and beaten to death, or you’ll get gang-raped, tortured, and turned into a sex slave, until you die of AIDS. Heck, if you’re white, you don’t have to have harmed a black, in order to suffer the aforementioned ends. Just being white is enough.

Will the American Christian lift his eyes from this world, from his best life now, and see a picture that spans the ages, from Adam to the anti-christ?. Lift up your eyes brothers and sisters and know that there is something unfolding. Will you cast your vote for an occultist because you are so entrenched in a system of the world? Is that how deeply entrenched the world is in your bones?

When the piano concluded and the violin took up one of Paganini’s Variations, the mood changed and the piece took off. Partnerings became compelling; patterns gained in interest and complexity; and humor was injected into the proceedings. There was a freshness and vibrancy to the dancing, particularly in the lovely lyricism of Soojin Choi. The insouciant pseudo-tutus on the ballerinas and peplum vests on the male dancers abetted the humor, reminding me of a Commedia dell’Arte cast of characters and their childlike antics.

However, as a former barrister trained at Grays Inn, London, Roland Sagah can only be too aware of what constitutes conflict of interest. And he knows that his new career as a part-time politician/ part-time construction company director is a very good example of it.
My husband suggested he use our Melissa and Doug pattern blocks to make a mosaic. He made a 100 with the red blocks and then filled in around it with the other blocks. We helped some, but he did most of it on his own. Then my husband helped him glue it all down on a sturdy piece of cardboard. They experimented with a few types of glue and found that wood glue worked the best.

Darker burgundy comes from another berry, green from the chilka leaf and shades of brown, black and white from the hair of the alpaca and the llama. ( The vicuna also provides wool of an extremely fine quality but this animal has never been domesticated. The Incans spent much time selectively breeding alpacas to obtain an extremely fine fleece but once their Empire ended that breeding program ended. In some of the museums in Peru examples of these old textiles can be viewed. ) The weavers also use indigo for blue. Indigo is not native so it is more expensive.
Let’s just say that only HALF of those Floridians use only ONE bottle of sunscreen this year. That’s 9,400,655 bottles of chemical laden, resource depleting, potentially hazardous product stinkin up our landfills! Even if we assume that two thirds of these Sun Patrons bought an environmentally healthy alternative, that’s still 3,133,552 bottles or so and that’s assuming that each person only uses/purchases one bottle!
My favorite is the Cottonmouth, a Belgian wheat beer; it's crisp and light. My husband likes the Stumpknocker IPA (of course). But what I really want to try and haven't found yet is Wild Night, their honey cream ale. If you're in the mood for a sturdy stout, their Midnight Oil coffee/oatmeal stout is... well, pretty damn stout. As much as I love stouts, I'm not a huge fan of coffee stouts--that's too much of a good thing, I think.

The meeting was interesting in that I felt my work wasn't universally liked but that reinforced a renewed determination to plough my own furrow. I generally do that anyway, but in the last few years I think I may have drifted into market-driven thought patterns for understandable but unhelpful reasons.
The electricity in my area shut down in the morning and was off all day, so we huddled under blankets and I read a book. Our poor dogs were freezing outside. We had to fortify their shelters as best as we could against the wind and gave them some old carpets and blankets to burrow under. I tried to get Rita and her puppy into the laundry room but she would have none of that - she insisted on being on the front porch, where she had full view of the gate and the main entrance to the house.
They say you never forget the day you bury your first pet. I remember when you lost Libby Girl and even though she wasn’t my dog, it felt like she was. She was the best dog I’ve ever known and I was as lost without her as you were. All my favorite memories included the three of us.

I could spout on about this album forever I think, there’s so many aspects to it, and every time I listen to it, I hear something new that I didn’t hear before, like it keeps revealing itself to me slowly so that I won’t get bored and put it down. It’s like the music version of porn!
One of the great miracles of life is birth and two physicians, Michael F. Roizen, MD, and Mehmet C. Oz, MD, have gotten together to write YOU Having A Baby: The Owner’s Manual to a Happy and Healthy Pregnancy ($18.00, Free Press, imprint of Simon and Schuster, softcover) that is a large compendium of information that will prepare anyone for the birth of a child. This is truly an A-to-Z treasure of information on topics that range from the biology of pregnancy to the fundamentals of child rearing. Together, they have answered most of the questions any new parent might want to ask. Parents often encounter two common ailments in their children and there’s a book to help when they do. Allergies and Asthma: What Every Parent Needs to Know, edited by Dr. Michael J. Welch ($14.95, American Academy of Pediatrics, softcover) is now in its second edition this month. Allergies and asthma often start in childhood and continue throughout life. Asthma currently affects around 6.2 million Americans under age 18. These young people often also have allergies. This book, written in easily comprehensible language, provides the latest findings on food allergies and treatments, as well as new approaches for monitoring asthma control. It’s the real deal.

I think, generally, life can be divided into cycles or phases. Simplisticly, I call them the 'up' cycle and the 'down' cycle. The 'up' cycle is basically when I feel the gods are smiling down on me. Everything fits. Everything feels great. The sun shines. The birds sing. You get the idea. The 'down' cycle is like a rainy day that never ends.
I can echo LaBeouf--there is too much unnecessary CGI. Gophers? Really, George Lucas? I actually felt saddened comparing the obvious blue screen backgrounds verses the actual sets used in the original films. I am not going to adamantly recommend The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull period, but I sorely advise you to not watch any all the previous films prior. By comparison, old fashioned art desin runs rings around CGI.

COLONIAL ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION: Up until mid-February, people were talking about the down year in the CAA. Then came Bracketbusters where the CAA once again flexed its mid-major muscle. Drexel, Virginia Commonwealth, George Mason and Old Dominion all scored big wins leading many pundits to say this is a multi-bid league again. I’m not so sure of that but I do know that Drexel and VCU will play a classic championship game. That game will be won by Drexel.

And that’s not all! It actually looks kind of really neat. I wish they had a real demo out, because it looks like it hits an amazing note of simplicity married to complexity that these sorts of games really need. It has a beautiful, clean interface (from the screens and videos I’ve seen) that just looks like a joy to observe while pretending it is a display on the deck of your command carrier. It’s unfortunately vague on a lot of gameplay specifics, because you know it’s a 4X so you… 4X things. It’s really hard to pin these sorts of games down without actually spend an hour or twenty with them, so that does make me pause. But fucking look at this:
Lucas Sebastian has never been one to ignore a lady in danger, even if she is trespassing on his property. Quickly disposing of her would-be assassin, he insists they keep the matter private. There are rumors enough already, about treasure buried under his garden, and occult botanical experiments performed by his uncle — who died of mysterious causes.

Anyhoo – all this jabber is just to say – I am still alive and kickin – a bit uncomfortably, but the kick may be a bit harder just because it makes me fighting mad sometimes when my weeks go painfully crappy like that. But hey… what would I be without something to jabber on about?
Today was an ordinary day by mom standards. Both children were sick. The house is a bit messy. The dishes are bathing in the sink…all day. The groceries have been haphazardly shelved in the pantry. Clothes for a sale (tomorrow) yet to be tagged. The house is full of the fresh smell of spring. The driveway is gallery to masterpieces. Amid all this seemingly ordinary I thank my God for the extraordinary. Because, really none of this is ordinary. It’s all quite amazing. I have been blessed beyond what I truly expected today. I awoke to sickness spilling out from two little rooms. Coughs and sniffles making way for a day I knew would be spent at home…and the doctor’s office. We made our way through the construction and midday traffic. We popped in and out of stores to gather the elixers and tinctures sure to stifle further illness. We arrived home. Home…no word is ever quite as sweet as HOME to a weary and tired soul. The mere sight as we turn down our street makes my heart leap for the peace of my home. With the dishes and groceries and fingerprints and all the stuff left undone. It’s my undone…it belongs to my family. It is our home…where we live FULLY.
I found this doing research on a project I’m working on. It’s about curcumin, an extract of tumeric, and is known as a “cancer fighter.”
However, although John Kerry could vote for the war before he voted against it, he would never vote for parental notification for minors obtaining abortion before voting against it, and he would never vote against partial birth abortion before voting for it. To do so would be to desert the left’s most deeply held desire, the desire for abortion on demand.
This time in our lives is all about media & social networking. For some (and I will include myself here) it has become almost an addiction. For some reason, knowing what other people are doing, uploading pictures, gaming, blogging, texting, & watching youtube videos has become more important than what is currently happening in our homes, in our relationships, and even our jobs. And we are not the only ones affected by this addiction. Our children & our spouses suffer the most.
The beautiful weather continues here in Dublin, and we continue to work in the allotment as much as we can while it lasts. I never thought I’d see the day when I’d be hoping for rain, but I am. We need it, my clay soil is baked and the water on site has not been turned on, thankfully there has been water provided in tanks and the supply is being switched on tomorrow morning. I am enjoying the sunshine immensely though, I even have a bit of a tan!

Pessimism of the intellect is how an intelligent person colors their glasses: they see the world as it is. As studies that depressives are more likely to think critically and be self-honest, optimists live longer. False hopes keeps many people alive, literally. Yet the turn of the gleeful pessimism who makes these faults not seem like faults seems like the most perverse dialectical move: Indeed, it brings the hope to the strange place. Your negative traits aren’t negative and you are fool for seeing them as such is the the implicit ideological impulse in the gap. This move is the inverted Diogenes: the man who bites himself so his friends can ignore their wounds.
But another important thing that takes place in the community of faith is the support we offer one another in all the seasons of life. It’s not a matter of ‘giving advice’ it is a matter of helping others to listen to the Spirit as decisions and situations are wrestled with.

If you're using Windows, you can also make use of a feature called Run As. To access this, hold you mouse over the shortcut - say Internet Explorer - and hold shift as you click with the right hand side mouse button. You should see an option to Run as a different user. Click that and enter the user name and password you created earlier. Internet Explorer will now open on the same desktop as your main user, but it will be under a different account, so the favourites and history will not mix in with yours. Sadly, this doesn't work with Firefox, but other browsers might be fine.

Second, the writers are clearly going to be playing up the religious fervor often found in the South. Not in a bad way, mind you, but in a way that makes it pretty clear that a tight-knit community such as Dillon is going to have a lot of church-goers who are always putting things in God’s hands. So far the big example is Lyla Garrity who keeps stubbornly promising Jason that everything is going to be alright and this trial is all part of God’s plan in some fashion.

I enjoyed the discussion of evolutionary biology leading to the concept that we were born to run distances. From an obstetrics point of view (my twisted view), I see the evolutionary biology he described in a different way. We’re the only species that can have obstructed labor, meaning we’re the only species that needs c-sections (well, except for English Bulldogs, but those are man-made). Why is that? Why would our pelvic bones be the same size, and sometimes smaller, than the heads of our offspring, leading to a high natural maternal mortality and infant mortality? Why would a baby have to twist and turn to come out? Well, it’s because we walk/run upright. It turns out that if our pelvises were any wider, then our hips would be too far apart to allow our knees to maintain stability under us. In fact, a women’s hips are already so far apart that the femur hits the tibia at an angle, putting greater stresses on our cruciate ligaments (hence why many women have torn ACLs like myself).
Certainly, the last of these doesn’t apply to me. We’ve Got a Job: The 1963 Birmingham Children’s March is my debut book. (That’s, after all, why I’ve been a member of EMU’s Debuts.) So, for these purposes, the book was birthed by a parent as nameless as a low-class Dickensian character. Nevertheless, I have a sense that this book is taking on a life of its own—so much so that zombie images have come to mind. It seems to be marching (appropriately) into newspapers, blogs, emails, stores, and conversations, without my presenting it to society accompanied by a proper introduction, as would be expected of an upper-class Dickensian character.

Thursday–On Thursdays I read emails and Twitter posts from our local farmers markets and farmers so I know what will be available over the weekend. These posts help so much. I highly recommend getting on the e-mail lists of any farmers markets or farmers near you. I can find out what vendors will be available, what they will have, what’s coming up soon and (if I want) I can even order specific products or cuts of meat ahead of time. I start making my draft menu for the next week at this point.
I’ll write about my Passover and Easter celebrations later on. I was hoping to come up with some sort of farewell message that was another alliteration but alas, I had none. Except for that small one I just made.
Kyle narrowly escapes when his airplane crashes on take-off, only to find himself stranded 2,000 miles from home in a country that has been forced, from a technological standpoint, back to the 19th Century. Confused, hurt, scared, and alone, Kyle must make his way across a hostile continent to a family he’s not even sure has survived the effects of the attack. As Kyle forges his way home, his frightened family faces their own struggles for survival in a community trying to halt its slow spiral into chaos and anarchy.

I try to keep light bulbs on hand although I don't like changing the bulbs. I don't know why I dislike doing it. It's a quick fix and makes everything look so much better, but even still, I just don't like to do it. So, that job is checked off. I think I might need to plan to do this once a month, maybe when I check the battery in my smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, just to make sure that it gets done.

This one surprised me. Again, a collective that owns a couple breweries, but I had no idea that their production was this high. Strangely, Redhook Longhammer IPA taps do seem to pop up EVERYWHERE. I've even seen one in a Southwest terminal at the Kansas City airport, being sold right next to cans of Tallgrass Buffalo Sweat. Either there are a lot more people drinking Redhook than I thought, or they just have some very aggressive sales reps that have scored accounts all over the place.
As I look more and more into “alternative” families I do wonder sometimes about the displacement of the dad. For example, I know a guy who is the father to a baby for two lesbians. He’s a straight guy and the one lesbian was his best friend, so he donated his man-stuff for her. The kid knows him, but he is definitely known as more of a “Super Uncle”. He’s Super Uncle Jim. Since Jim is a poet and has an unstable living situation, this is a great arrangement for him. He sees the kid when he wants and gets to be a dad – on the side. But, what about the gay men who do NOT want to be dads on the side? Sure they can adopt or have their own kids via a surrogate, but I think a lot of times they get left out of the “alternative” family building process because chicks still own their uteruses – even though the government often thinks THEY own them, but that’s a subject for another post by another blogger.
That’s when I thought nothing is as it seems.No tomorrow can be predicted accurately .We can just plan,hope,wish or pray for things but then there is a higher power in action who makes everyday different for every person so that he/she can learn ,grow and live to be a better person.

In this gauntlet of openness to new ways of thinking, Mercury makes an action-demanding link to Pluto the transformer. Caution goes out the window. Raw truths, even secrets, come to the surface.

The cumulative result is streamlining, liberating, motivating and energizing.

In short: a good publicist can work wonders when you do everything right, but they're by no means necessary and are often an extraneous expense. Make sure you know what you're getting into beforehand. As always, talk to your agent.

It has an odd, hollow, cardboard bitterness that I notice more than anything right up front, which makes it taste like a stronger golden ale. Like adjuncts. Cheap. It fades quickly to an alcohol bite, and all of that malt disappears quickly. The bitter harshness just isn't right for the type.

Don’t be intimidated in any way by your enemies. This will be a sign to them that they are going to be destroyed, but that you are going to be saved, even by God himself.
Mr. Coenie Pitout (35), Father of 2 little girls was shot 4 times by 3 intruders who broke into the family's home. Mr. Pitout's wife woke him up when she heard noises. Wrongly assuming his wife had heard the children he did not take any weapon with him. On entering the kitchen he was shot in the left cheek at close range by one of three intruders who confronted him. He put up a fight and was stabbed and shot a second time. The report then states that he managed to free his one daughter from one of the attackers so both girls could get to their Mother in the bedroom which has somewhat sinister implications. The mother then broke a window and fled to the neighbours.

Today whatever pandemonium we seen in Pakistan is due to Indians and CIA in Afghanistan. Enemy’s jugular passes through Pakistan and today when we have got hold of that jugular and have stopped their supplies, what has America been able to do in retaliation? What can they do to Pakistan? They are dying in Afghanistan and cannot do anything about it. Their economy at home has collapsed. Soviet Union did not get the biggest defeat in the battlefield, but they suffered so much losses due to war that they were unable to sustain themselves. Same is happening to America now. By stopping the supply lines, Pakistan has multiplied their losses.

So, that's what I spontaneously wrote a few months ago for no particular reason. Then, it occurred to me that I would be speaking here to you fine folks, and I had better give a little thought to what I wanted to, you know, talk about. I knew that I wanted to talk about relationships, since that's a big area of interest for me. But, every time I'd sit down to write about relationships, I'd get a little hung up. Then, the light bulb went on over my head and I realized that it would be disingenuous of me to talk with authority about anything other than -- me. I realized that until I could speak my story, I probably would not be able to access the other stuff I had to say. So, here's how things started for us.

He's a little late for that. He ignores my request about the warrant, and proceeds to find and arrest Michael Anderson. I stand in my living room and watch the agents running around here to there. I look at one who is holding his rifle next to a car. He looks at me for a second, then moves behind the car and continues to watch. I look at my 6-year-old twin girls; they are scared to death. I hold my hands out far from my sides for "them" to see.

A young man met us outside to let us into the complex which needed remote-key entry. My co-worker said he had once looked into getting an apartmet in this very building. The client, we’ll call him Jeff, was not much older than me. I’m going to guess around 32 or so. He showed us into his unit. A classy loft-style apartment with a large brick wall inside, modern kitchen, clean bathroom and two bedrooms. It was soon to become his former residence. He looked around at his stuff and told us he needed to get rid of the couch, coffee table, queen matress and bed frame, a fully equipped and functioning stereo system and a small dresser.

In Going Postal, Terry Pratchett makes memorable the name of antihero Moist von Lipwig, which takes some doing. As a skilled conman Moist is a master at offering others the “prospect of hope”, but it seems rather unfair when all his efforts to escape Ankh-Morpork and its patrician Lord Vetinari start becoming only prospects of freedom. From being hanged in the morning to being forced to accept a government job in the afternoon would be enough to drive anyone mad. Add in a golem for a parole officer, a decrepit Post Office building complete with fanatic tenants for a home, and a cynical Miss Dearheart for a love interest, and Moist’s new career seems hopeless. Fortunately, the discovery that mysterious forces killed the previous four postmasters died suspiciously, and that the head of the rival communications giant of clacks, or telegrams, has a brutal business agenda convinces Moist that he must rise to the occasion. At least it all comes with a hat.

The scream hung in the air like the waxing moon outside my window. I touched my face, expecting to feel the wound there, my skin cut somehow as Myrddin’s had been in the dream. My trembling fingers came away clean. My heart raced as my mind recovered, but I tore from my bedchamber nonetheless, darting through the shadowed hallways of Grandfather’s household, avoiding the guards that stood, dozing, at the ends of corridors.

Amy and Roger's Epic Detour is an amazing road trip. Really. They take turns picking destinations, and make all kinds of discoveries along the way: discoveries about America, and about themselves. From the Loneliest Road in America to the deliciousness of Chick-fil-A, Amy and Roger are taking each mile of the trip as it comes, never knowing what awaits them. As Amy gradually adjusts to being around people again, she starts realizing that things can't stay bottled inside forever. She and Roger make a true connection, and he helps her gently but steadily break down the walls she put up and deal with the raw emotion she's kept hidden so long. This isn't all Amy's story however, and Roger learns to see past his own mistakes and look more clearly at life. In finding the best eats and chasing down windmills (a`la Don Quixote), Amy and Roger's epic detour becomes a literal journey to new life.

The problem should be obvious: It would take years to watch all of this, maybe a lifetime. When I was a young man, I didn’t have a lot of money, but was really excited about this new-fangled DVD thing. I bought a significant number of DVDs, but watched most of them within a few days of purchase. After a while of this, I found myself working a block from a used CD/DVD store and pulling in lots of overtime. They had an ongoing special where if you bought three items of the same price, the fourth would be $2.50. I didn’t want to pay more than was optimal, so I always bought in groups of four. They could keep lists of movies I wanted and call me when they go them in, so I had reason to make frequent trips and DVD Profiler kept track of everything I wanted so I could be sure to give them a thorough list. It was pretty common for me to walk in there and buy sixteen or so movies. Sometimes, I’d buy eight or so seasons of TV material. Since I was working about seventy hours a week, I would maybe get around to watching one or two of these. It didn’t take long before I owned more DVDs that I hadn’t watched than had. I made numerous efforts to cut back, but then would see an amazing deal and buy a few dozen movies that I didn’t have time to watch.
On the eve of his wedding he used his favourite sword to remove him and his true love to another realm.
I’ve been torn recently in the presidential debate, in case my recent blogs haven’t explicitly shown that. As a full fledged, non-committed moderate, I can’t tell who I want to win. If the vote was today, and in some bizarre, impossible way, Romney, Gingrich and Obama all ended up on the ballot, I would not know who to vote for. That being said, I have my favorites.
"Mr. Meyers went straight home, straight to the basement, unpacked his equipment and started a new batch. Mrs. Meyers kidded later that it was the first time in their forty years of marriage that he had come into the house and started working without kissing her first.

The standing joke of the year
If anything, there is a lot to be learned on the long tail from the growth of mobile phones (cell phones), and importantly, we have a much longer timeframe graph to compare the growth of the mobile phone to the growth of the ebook. Market saturation is not something you are going to hear for a long time with ebook devices, but the day will come, because the history of Apple and Microsoft in the computer operating system war will tell you a thing or two about controlling content. For so long, Microsoft believed controlling the device made you king, but in the long tail Apple showed that content was king with their 'app' for anything drive.

I wrote about this trend for The New York Times last year — after two publications did their level best to screw me out of almost $7,000 I’d earned. One owed me $5,600 and sent me emails telling me of their financial troubles. Like I care. If I can run my business efficiently, so can you. I found a contingency lawyer, sued and won half (the lawyer, sad to say, took a third of that.) I hired another lawyer — a softball buddy who helped out for two bottles of Stoli — whose letter to the other deadbeat produced payment within two days of his letter, after months of nyah-nyahing and stonewalling.
The surviving Night Elves converted to Druidism, and any practice of Arcane magic was forbidden. But the Highborne were still addicted to magic far deeper than those Night Elves who had lived further from the influence of the Well, and they spent much of their time seeking out new sources. Eventually, the leader of the Highborne confronted Malfurion and the Druids, declaring them cowards for their shunning of Arcane magic.
I finally gave up and went down to the ground floor of lifestyle to atleast pick up the cosmetics that I wanted to pick up. Walking down the aisle of the makeup counters this is what I heard.

Luckily there are many wonderful bloggers out there who were keeping up with their blogs and offering fantastic resources so that I could be able to put together some fun lessons for my students. I have especially enjoyed all the gingerbread ideas floating around out there in blogland. I have always taught using the different gingerbread stories but now I have math stations and write the room stations and word work to go with it. THANKS!

I've been busy building two brick pillars in the front garden to match the others so that the twisted fence panels can be fixed to them to straighten them out. I would prefer a brick wall, but I don't have enough old bricks...they are hard to find. Here they are all stained and straight...I just have the tops of the pillars to do. The gravel has just arrive so I'll be busy with the drive now.

His pursuers were gaining on him. If only he could reach his TARDIS! He tripped and fell into the mud. He looked up, realising with horror that he had come to a dead end in the trench. He turned around to see his pursuers bear down on him.
First it seems she thinks that the only reason people would choose to show the military in a positive light is because they’re being paid to…and not because, well, they live in reality. I don’t know about the rest of you, but I wanted to be in the military, I couldn’t pass the physicals, but I wanted to be in the military and admire to no end those who did what I could not. And I simply cannot understand the mindset of someone who does not find it honorable that someone chooses to put their life on the line to defend the rights of another. And then she simply equates the military with violence. Actually, idiot, the military is what protects us from violence, but I shouldn’t expect intelligence like that from a liberal. Quite frankly Wolf’s outlook is just a little sick and perverted and just a bit dishonorable.

This 1931 song gives a hint of the spell cast by Bing Crosby, Russ Columbo and Rudy Vallee when they performed at the Brooklyn Paramount Theatre, one of the major stages where these legendary troubadours pioneered the art of popular singing and minted the template for the musical idol, which has become a mainstay of our popular culture.
Since I make this for the girls, I add the jalepeno last, but if I were making it for just Matt and I, I would add a jalepeno, to the crockpot when cooking so the sauce would be spicy, since Indian food is typically very spicy.
Acting wise the movie is just superb. Out of the three main actors it’s Keira Knightley that really steals the show as Sabina Spielrein, the woman that caused the fracture between Jung and Freud. I can see many actresses just over playing the role as the role does lend itself to the insanity. Yet while she does have her wild moments there are touches of the subtle woven throughout. Looking back on how she played some of the scenes, there is such a genius in every movement. Fassbender as Carl Jung is also excellent as the young psychologist trying to flesh out his ideas and most importantly figure out the best way to help people. Viggo Mortensen as Sigmun Freud rounds out the awesome trio. I think he’s the weakest of the three but only because he’s not given as much time to develop as a character. Still Viggo grabs onto the role and throttles as much as he can out of it.
The highlight for me, though, was the soundtrack. It featured some truly stellar protest folk songs, which sadly I have not yet located for purchase. There was a bizarrely beautiful scene where a guitar-strumming troubadour leads a group of youths to safety, Pied Piper-style, that I had to rewind and watch again.
Or, paint it all black and distress to expose some of the wood. Or stripping the entire thing and re-staining a nice dark walnut. Decisions, decisions. I hope to get started this weekend. Feel free to weigh in.

Packages must look appealing on the shelf; websites and blogs have more stickiness if they feature rich imagery and video. We are visual creatures. “Intense and prominent cues (those that are louder, more colorful, bigger, brighter, etc.) increase the probability of attracting attention,” Terence A. Shimp writes in his Advertising, Promotion and Other Aspects of Integrated Marketing Communications. In online dating, pictures matter more than one’s love of animals, time spent in the Peace Corps, or triathlon training in a profile description. OKcupid.com even did a study of what picture types work and what’s better left for your mom.
The island people are speechless and stand in awe, unaware that their day to day perceived freedoms are non existent but they are unknowingly moulded and cunningly crafted to ensure unwanted Multiculturism is thrust upon them without dissent.

Five of our group came out for the intervals and we decided on a warm-up lap followed by 3 minutes hard running/3 minutes aggressive walking that we would repeat six times. I set up my Garmin to allow for the warm-up and then chime when it was time to transition every three minutes. We all stayed together during the warm-up lap and when the lap was over, I hit my lap button and yelled “Run!” and we were off!

Now in the land of online news, people are not called upon to write multi-paragraph essays to demonstrate their understanding of articles. But people feel compelled to write comments on material they read and/or engage in dialogue around it, and I do enjoy this democratic freedom. What is painful to me — when I feel interested enough in an article to read some of the commentary — is the seemingly poor reading comprehension of the readers. So many comments (especially the hyper-critical or extremely favorable ones) don’t seem to reflect what is actually written.
One of my goals in 2009 is to try at least 1 new recipe a week. I have so many wonderful, healthy, lowfat/low-cal cookbooks, and I’m looking forward to trying out a bunch of new meals.

A central question of both the exhibition and the super-workshop will be how future tools of landscape investigation—new spatial devices on a variety of scales, from the inhabitable to the portable—can be imagined, designed, and fabricated. These include objects, models, prototypes, graphics, and speculative proposals, ranging from the physical to the digital, from the geological to the conceptual, from the felt to the heard, and from deep-time to the hand-made.
Food! Don't worry, I won't forget the food. The food is what brought this blog out of me. I love writing and sometimes wish I had the time to do more of it, but this blog has allowed me to bring together my love of creating healthy, good food for my family and friends and write about it. How wonderful is that? I know I need to get back to some food posts - I really haven't forgotten that is the reason I'm here!
And instead of walking out with one item (which was my plan... I NEVER take them all in to get more than three things unless they are confined to a cart... for that seems to be our chaos threshold), we walked out with SIX individual items. And to be honest, we probably could have been good for a few more.

Many of the rites of "witchcraft" in the middle ages were no different of the ritual sex and sacred marriage of the fertility cults of the old and new testaments. With focus on goddess worship, human fertility, earth fertility, the use of herbal potions, and yielding to supernatural powers via sexual orgies or ecstatic intoxication with alcohol and drugs. In fact the notion of witches being able to fly came from such drug induced delusions.

The conference bridge automatically sends me an email at the end of every conference call across the company, listing the total minutes, the number of participants and the number they called in from. So when I got this e-mail…I had to stare at it for a minute:

I hated throwing it down the drain so I froze every last ounce of that liquid gold. By the time my son was 6 months old I had filled my entire freezer!! I did not want it to go bad so I starting calling around to the hospitals and other organizations to find out if I could donate it. In the process of making calls I found out there was this gal on the other side of town that was getting ready to bring her first baby home from Korea. A beautiful 5 month old baby girl with unrepaired cleft lip and palette.

I realised at the last minute that I had loads of dye salt but no dye fix. A quick look on the interweb told me I could use washing soda (nope haven’t got any of that) or sodium carbonate, AKA soda ash (nope, haven’t got any of… wait a minute!) Soda ash is commonly used in glazes, and what do I have a workshop full of? That’s right, glaze ingredients. Woo! I found some and fixed my dye. It worked perfectly, and was probably cheaper than the Dylon stuff.

Coincidentally, among the "core cities" with the whitest populations, Portland is first at 74% and Pittsburgh is second at 67%. In contrast, Pittsburgh's Robber Baron-era rival Cleveland is only 37% white. But that doesn't have anything to do with why Pittsburgh is slowly becoming hip while Cleveland is stagnating. Don't even think that.
But he was asked if the NotW paid “corrupt” police officers. Therefore he could say that the NotW did not pay “corrupt” officers, but instead paid honest ones. As the wise blogger and Twitterer @loveandgarbage pointed out, the Prevention of Corruption legislation makes payments like this illegal both by the donor and the recipient. However, if Mr Coulson believed these were legitimate payments, tied in perhaps with the “crime fighting” role of the NotW, then the fact that, in law, recipients of the payments were ipso facto “corrupt” would not be enough, in my view, to establish perjury. Ignorance of the law cannot make a statement false where the person believes it to be true.

Urging the PM to advise the Yang di Pertuan Agong to form a tribunal immediately, Mat Zain said Najib should do it before he goes on his impending vacation – if he felt deceiving the Agong and Conference of Rulers was a serious matter.
God gives enough time for conviction and knows when the time is right. It took those who demanded the death of Christ 40 days to be ready for the day of Pentecost. Then at Pentecost when the twelve apostles preached, many were ready to receive and in Acts 2:41, “there were added unto them about three thousand souls.”

In terms of decision processes and style, Jobs was famous for being a tough micro-manager, at least where product design decisions are concerned. As a Fortune magazine article on Apple’s culture put it: “He’s a corporate dictator who makes every critical decision—and oodles of seemingly noncritical calls too, from the design of the shuttle buses that ferry employees to and from San Francisco to what food will be served in the cafeteria.”
Could I ever have something so complex?
Finally, a workshop on Troilo. Joaquin objects to the idea of learning to dance 'to Troilo', 'to D'Arienzo', 'to Di Sarli': 'Which D'Arienzo?' he asks. Each orquesta sounded different at different periods, and they all sound remarkably similar to each other at any one period. He plays a track from 1942 and asks us which orquesta it is. We'd been listening to Troilo and just danced a track of Di Sarli: it could well be Di Sarli. But it's D'Arienzo.
Very strange. I just tried calling the store's telephone number, but it has been disconnected.
Okay, so. I’m reading a lot about how Dynasty Young‘s mom shouldn’t have sent him to school with a taser, generally because two wrongs don’t make a right yada yada self-defense perpetuates the cycle of violence blah blah I am a privileged piece of shit who can count on people to sympathize with my problems and either protect or avenge me should things really get messy etcetera etcetera some Just World Fallacy in there as well because if Dynasty got expelled then he and his family definitely did something wrong here or it wouldn’t have happened.

In 2003, I spoke with Justice Falerdeau, and with the two lawyers involved in this case. It was clear that Justice Falerdeau's decision was based on the evidence before him. It was not even considered that having an autistic child was anything less than devastating. It was not even considered that Charles-Antoine was anything but the burden described by the President of Montreal's autism society. Everyone saw Charles-Antoine as a burden. No one questioned this. And in the media, Ms Lahaie implied that he was better off dead--happy, to be murdered.
* Release poisonous/toxic self-talk. Do you find yourself repeatedly defining yourself in limiting ways? Do you find yourself being overly critical and judgmental of your actions and your overall state of being? What we consistently tell ourselves about ourselves becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. It’s wise to be very aware and discerning of what we believe we are capable of. We make this our truth. Why not create a new story that reflects the beauty, purity and worthiness of our spirit? We have that daily option. We deserve this. Each of us can begin right now. We can shift those old, limiting stories into bright, expansive stories that honor our spirit and allow for the success that is ever-present and always awaits us.

She steps out of her Lexus and walks toward the curb of the front of her house. She looks to the right and see’s her neighbors and gets annoyed. She gets pissed. She is infuriated!
But return he did, starting for the first time since September, coming out of nowhere he slotted into a front four comprising of Nasri, Silva and Aguero whose interplay, pass completion and shots on goal as a unit also…well…came out of nowhere. No longer ‘carrying the team’, Tevez scored a goal, followed by a humble celebration and didn’t complain about taken off. Change.
Conclusion: Sarah and Todd were both photoshopped into the picture from two separate photos and whoever did it, made an awful job of trying to get the perspective right.
The last time I went in, the member of staff again apologised, explained that she was there for the foreseeable future as they had had a lot of complaints about the store. I told her this was the last time I'd be coming into store - if I didn't get it this time I'd be informing trading standards and expect the contract cancelled immediately. A shame because Orange have actually been very helpful each time I've had to call them. A couple of clicks on the computer and the form I needed was printed out. I was speechless. All the time I'd wasted, driving in monthly to be lied to when they could have printed out the form instantly. I signed the form in front of her, went home, got the first bill and sent it off.

This is what happens when temporary politicians make laws that restrict our freedom. Thank God the Supreme Court got it right. And this drives the Left nuts.

Out went the bags, and the cleaners went into a bucket to help keep them in place. I really hate how the pipes and garbage disposal are! I wish I could change it, but it's going to have to stay! I finally have a place for my step stool! It's been floating around from place to place, but I think I will keep it here from now on. I got the idea from visiting little raindrops blog. I was going to put some shelf liner on the bottom, but forgot until after I was all done. I may still do it later.
The conflicting messages that come out of the ANC these days bring that inescapable impression of internal chaos and warring groups that manoeuvre behind the scenes, organising and re-organising, ready to pounce.
Are these “special provisions” for women or just outright discrimination against men? How can the court come to the conclusion that the, marriage has broken down, yet deny the same relief to him, that in the other way around, the courts would have readily handed it to the woman?
Add some mint for a fresh burst of flavor.
For me, the principles of thriller-writing are the same whoever you're writing for! Personally I think that the story is 'king' and if you keep your focus on making sure everything you write serves the core story then all the rest follows on from there. My editor totally gets the way I write and is very open to my ideas. She offers brilliant advice and comments on the first draft of the work I send her. I'd say I probably take on board about 90 per cent of her suggestions.

It is a fact, which no one will deny, that the crime of rape was substantially unknown during the period of slavery, and was hardly known during the first years of freedom: it is the fatal product of new conditions. Twenty-five years ago women in the South went unattended, with no more fear of attack than they have in New England. To-day, no woman in the South goes alone upon the highway out of sight of white men, except on necessity, and no man leaves his women alone in his house if he can help it. Over 500 white women and children have been assaulted in the South by Negroes within that time. (T.N. Page, 1904)

So my neighbor, the one who talks a lot, stops me to say he is sorry. So I just listened. He proceeded to say that the other day he was walking to the lawn man about his dog and how she is over weight and need some exercise. He thought I over heard that and thought he was talking to me. After he was finished telling his story I told him I had not heard any of that. Wow…. people pfft…
Anyway, I'll leave you with the above photograph of her brother Dave's dog Monty - 'a right good dog, my mother-in-law said warmly - and a recipe for 'Slims' which my grandmother-in-law wrote down in her recipe book - which incidentally is crammed with newspaper wartime recipes, so it's additionally fascinating.

Hard to believe it's been a month since our last post. Xiao Ya is gaining weight, height and words like mad. The fine folks at the cardiology department of Children's National Medical Center gave her the closest thing to a clean bill of health that such a specialty can offer -- asking to see her just once a year and suggesting she can run marathons if she'd like.
Speaking of which, Michael Biehn brings his great, natural humanity to Corporal Hicks. He shows the character to be a natural leader with confidence, decisiveness, and intelligence. Hicks is definitely the guy that will have your back all the way. Just as he was in The Terminator, Biehn shines through as a wonderfully dynamic and emotionally powerful actor. His warmth and chemistry with Sigourney strikes the right, soft chord. They work extremely well together with a mutual respect that penetrates through the screen. I’m not sure that the original casting choice of James Remar would’ve embodied those qualities so strongly or naturally. Michael Biehn was an amazing, fortunate happenstance in this instance.
"If she had a warning label, it would read: “Good friend, not great. Talks more than listens. May or may not have a conscience. Manipulative in an emergency. Needs constant attention. May or may not be capable of authentic connections. Should not be exposed to displays of sickness, grief, shame. May contain traces of fraudulence." In the second story, "Love Seat" was one I had difficulty to connecting to; it's a sort of twisted love story involving the Grateful Dead and a lot of tanning lotion and a radio show host. I actually enjoyed the beginning, before it got into all the Grateful Dead stuff, since I've never listened to the band and all the connections and symbols just didn't make sense to me. It might work better for an older, or more musically literate, reader.

The nature of the problem is made clear by the first five points above, and the moral nature of a robust response to Islamization the sixth. Islam is a totalitarian political ideology, impossible to reform on any useful timescale, impossible to supplant once deeply embedded, demographically destined to become ever more threatening, from which we cannot simply separate, and which we owe no consideration. What would a Europe that had succeeded in defending itself against this cancer look like?
When we look for candidates to the priesthood and as we pray for vocations, we are looking for men who are brave in their willingness to seek holiness, to speak the truth, to lay down their lives. There is no place in the priesthood today for “wimpish-ness.” There is no place for an attitude that just wants to please people, no matter what they think and no matter what they want. Today the priest has to stand up and be brave, preaching the Truth with love. He has to be willing to be unpopular. And if it comes to it, he has to be open to martyrdom.
In a recent opinion, two federal appeals court judges suggested that all efforts to protect workers, consumers or the environment were unconstitutional, including regulatory efforts by the states. It’s a radical view, but one that has gotten increasing traction in conservative legal circles. It is also the culmination of years of institutional investments by the corporate Right to advance what’s come to be known as the “law and economics” movement, which analyzes legal rulings “costs” – essentially applying neoliberal economic logic to the field. Its advocates eschew the notion that human rights or economic fairness are inherently valuable factors for the law to consider.

So, after a couple of days struggling with a massive allergy and asthma attack, I prescribed prednisone and antibiotics for myself and am feeling much better. So today I went exploring Barrio Chino with the lovely Ms. Jolie and her charming daughter, who immediately won my heart as she reminded me so very much of my goddaughter at that age, whom I miss incredibly.

Superman appeared most regularly on sports pages. While Jack Dempsy insisted that “It will take a superman to beat” boxer Tom Heeney, football stars Red Grange and Frank Johavac were both declared “Superman.” Babe Ruth was a “Baseball Superman,” as was Giants pitcher Red Ruffing, and golfer Cecil Leitch was a “superwoman of the links.”

Don't get me wrong, there's lots of booze to choose from--50ish beers and even more wines--but if you rule out the stuff you can find at your local grocery store, it's not jaw-dropping. So my first impression, after parking ourselves at a small two-top in the appropriately noisy bar area some 90 minutes earlier than our projected seating time, was to be slightly underwhelmed at the pub element.

As a person with a passing appreciation for roses, Otherwise Normal People brought to life the richness of variety and deep history of the rose. I will never look at them in quite the same way. The enthusiasm of rosarians is infectious and I found myself eyeing a spot or two in the yard that looked a bit bare.
Tash had read the books Niall had given her from cover to cover and was sticking to their advice diligently. One said to build a relationship with one's horse out of as well as in, the saddle.

Heaven Is for Real, Todd Burpo - A young 4-year old boy meets Jesus during a health crisis, but doesn't mention it to his minister dad until months later. This is the true story of Colton Burpo, who had an emergency appendectomy, went to heaven, met Jesus and God and his own grandfather, and has spent years telling his parents what happened. So heartwarming, so easy to read: read it in one sitting! I passed it along to my mom, who ALSO read it in one sitting! Lovely story! (Thanks to my SIL for giving it to me to read!)

As you know Darby has dyslexia. His eyes aren't quite as fit as the rest of this body which means he has trouble reading. He is currently in Year 3 and reading at a Year 1 level. The interesting thing is he loves the reading experience. He is quite good with his comprehension, fantastic with facts, ability to predict, character assessment, creating stories of his own and the like. He just can't read easily. He also understands many of the rules of punctuation, he can spell out loud, he has a huge vocabulary and is very articulate with his words. He just can't write easily. Dyslexia is like that.
OH! And yesterday I took a day trip to Pennsylvania with a group from church. Dennis took the day off and stayed with his mom. We went up to the Sights & Sounds Theater -- this time to see the story of Joseph and his multi-colored coat. It was FABULOUS! Of course it was! We had lunch at an Amish Inn... the food of course was excellent... and of course I ate too much! But I let myself do these things on occasion and just accept a little gain should it happen. I thought for SURE I would gain after St. Patrick's Day - but I didn't! It was amazing! Perhaps I will be so blessed THIS time too! Tomorrow is weigh day so I will know then.

After letting go, I grew to really love the cast, especially all the magnificent circus folk and their wonderful wardrobes and tricks. New characters were brought in for each episode and they were great! The acting and writing was delightful. A big world unfolded and threads were left hanging to bring back characters after they left.. more and more threads came together, the show got even crazier and more ridiculous... and then CUT! The end.

My little sister. She didn't hop on a plane. She hopped in her car with her husband and a six month old. In addition to dinner and laundry, she and her husband D fenced and planted my garden. She did dishes. He rigged the feeder in my chicken coop to go up and down so the mice wouldn't eat all the chicken feed. He entertained their little one (translate: he drove around a lot) so Laura could sit in the NICU with me. That was most important.
She’d needed to know that it’s OK to feel. And sometimes, you just have to break the rules, and do what you know you should.

If I have to choose one of the 7 that Joyce has listed, I would choose an all-day movie marathon, but if I could choose whatever I wanted to do on a rainy day, I suspect that I’d choose quilting, but then again I’d probably put on some of my favorite movies to “watch” while quilting … so maybe I am going with one of Joyce’s choices after all.
This morning, however, for some strange reason, the class just fell apart. There was a sense of rhythm being lost: of neat and tidy dance co-ordination giving way to fluttery chaos.

“The drive of the Rockefellers and their allies is to create a one-world government combining super capitalism and Communism under the same tent, all under their control…. Do I mean conspiracy? Yes I do. I am convinced there is such a plot, international in scope, generations old in planning, and incredibly evil in intent.”- Congressman Larry P.

The 5th episode of the series was surprising. The story of Rin begins to unfold, I don’t see her as a secret anymore, even though there are some sides of her I am not aware of. She graduates from kindergarten and Daikichi meets her mother(which I find very naive and unprepared for this world, really. she seems like one of these people with their heads in the clouds). Finally, I must say, as I’ve been waiting to meet Rin’s mother for a long time. Although the story of Rin is quite tragic, the creators manage to keep it light and cute, which is my favourite thing about Usagi Drop.
Celebrants drank more beer than was probably wise, pulled out their barbecues in the parking lot, and sunbathed on their lawn chairs as though on a seaside holiday. There were costumes, bedlam, and nonsense. People skied in grass skirts, bikinis, sequins, and outrageous outfits of all hues. The atmosphere was raucous ebullience with a hedonistic flair. So, of course, we couldn't stay away!
We walked today, my son strapped to my front looking at the world with fresh eyes and me having a big think. As we passed by the infamous taxi stand where two sets of people stole a cab from me while I was in labor in the middle of a snowstorm, I got enraged all over again and thought that most of all, I will not miss the lack of community in this area and the general frosty and negative attitude. BUT....I WILL miss walking a block to the Seine river, the beauty of my surroundings, my boucher and cheeseman but most of all, my dearly beloved and worshipped Eric Kayser bakery, also known as the best bakery in the entire universe and beyond. It's currently donut season there so I ate 12 of them yesterday in honor of my departure....
For years, I've been lamenting society's trend toward "hotness." In days gone by, women were pretty and elegant...sexy even...without having to dress sluttishy in the process. A woman's attractiveness and sex appeal came from other things than being nearly completely exposed, and I believe that as we women have taken to dressing so provocatively, we have become little more than sex objects. So, as for me, I'll take "pretty" over "hot" ANY day of the week!!
When Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of the Testimony in his hands, he was not aware that his face was radiant because he had spoken with the LORD. When Aaron and all the Israelites saw Moses, his face was radiant, and they were afraid to come near him.

One morning I got up and was really spending some time praying about these issues. Was this really what God was asking us to do? Did He really want us to be foster parents here, now? In my reading and praying, I felt an overwhelming sense of confirmation that this was exactly what we were supposed to do! We were ready, God had put us in this place for just this thing, and we should move forward without hesitation. I finished my devotions and went to take a shower.
Now they are clean, I feel less aggressive, and I have two more hours that I will actually be able to enjoy instead of sitting around sulking.

Dark Spaces lie between, and within, our constructed places of light. They are inherently existent, as a means to differentiate between that which is foreground, middle-ground, and far-ground, and that which is vertically shallow, or exhibiting depth. Dark Space is shapeable, as it is with Light Space, yet Light Space (in seeking to remain transparent) becomes highly reflective of the personalities and forms which inhabit it.
This record, therefore, comes with my highest recommendations, with a big nod specifically to fans of the previously mentioned Metheny and The Rippingtons.

As is our custom we decided that we would eat first, then go to show Maddie some of the great decorations in the neighborhood, then when we came back Santa would have arrived and we would proceed with opening the presents. M-t-G wasn't too thrilled with having to wait and said she wasn't hungry. I asked her if we let her have one present to open would she then come and eat without complaint until we were all done? She agreed (she is only 9 after all). We all agreed it was a plan and so we proceeded. It turned out that we each opened one gift and then went in to eat. (I guess we're all 9 at heart!)

Turkle's article starts this way, "We live in a technological universe in which we are always communicating. And yet we have sacrificed conversation for mere

I tried on a pair of slacks and a sport jacket. Stepping into an alcove of mirrors, I saw something I believe I was noticing for the first time. Not only was a mirror right in front of me, but booking off to either side were two other mirrors. By turning slightly, I could view the fit of the clothes, not just from the front, but from all sides. I could even position myself in such a way to see the back of my own head.

Consider the apostle preaching on Mars Hill in Acts 17:32. “And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked; and others said, We will hear thee again of this matter…Howbeit certain men clave unto him.” To those mockers and procrastinators Paul could well have said, “Ye should have hearkened unto me.”

Jesus is described as coming from Nazareth, however it is disputed whether there was such a town during his time. There is confusion over whether or not he had a family.

Each day this week open your heart to God’s grace and generosity with a “breath prayer.” Let your breath slow and deepen. Be aware of God’s breath moving in and out of your heart. Spend several minutes focusing on breathing in God’s generosity. With each breath, silently name one gift for which you are thankful. “God, I breathe in the gift of with thanks.” Let your heart expand to contain God’s gracious outpouring.
a) Photopage of passport
(We see domineering aunts, for example, from both North and South, who want to "rule" over their nephews and nieces.) There is a generation (probably those fifty and up) who CANNOT for one minute put the Civil War behind them, and there is a generation (especially those in their twenties and late teens) who don't quite understand why it still has to be such a big deal, who'd like to see some change or progress at least. There's definitely still tension between North and South as well. Our narrator is a "Yankee" visiting a Southern town. His "Yankee" aunt warns him throughout not to be too influenced by the Southerners. She doesn't want him to like or love his travels too much. And the people of the town, especially the Somebodies of the town, find it hard to open up with any Yankee no matter how seemingly charming. From the narrator's viewpoint, readers see the tension between these two sides is still very much alive. Race. This is a BIG, BIG, BIG issue in the novel. For better or worse. On one hand, it could always allow for discussion and critical thinking on the part of the reader. But on the other hand, it might make some very uncomfortable in the process. Because whether the "racism" is just racism by condescension or racism by pure ugliness and hatred, it is still very present in this novel. (Let's just say that the narrator and almost every single person in the novel does NOT believe in equality of the races, and most certainly does not believe that they should have the right to vote or hold any sort of political office.) Social class also plays a role in this one. We've got the tension between people who once had money but now only have class, manners, and pride. And the newly rich who many view as having NO class, and low morals.

Casting-wise this thing is a filmic wet-dream. It also opens up for a few fascinating possibilities… Such as, what if Nick Fury is just Jackson’s character from Snakes on a Plane having found a new purpose in life? (Explains the eye patch, right?) What if all Mark Ruffalo’s romantic comedies from now on are required to have him turn green and grab the female protagonist and fling her about her bedroom like a rag doll? What if Stellan Skarsgard learned a real accent and not that nether-region of a mangled mess of phonemes he currently uses? A better universe for everyone, I feel.

Then I remembered the caramel marscapone frosting I made for the Pierre Hermes Apricot Lime Financier Cake. That was not too sweet, had a little burnt sugar taste and would go well with toasted walnuts. As I was making it the thought of dates went through my head, their sweetness, the deep subtle flavor they would add, why not?
The story was also mega rare because at the time Western publishing had no desire to reprint the thing as some of the islanders depicted seemed to fall into the racial stereotyping quagmire and it wasn't until Oberon in Holland decided in the late 1970's to reprint ALL the Barks classic stories that this tale was dusted off and represented with the aid of genius draftsman Daan Jippes tracing some very shoddy photostats of the original comic.

This is quite concerning as the poll is is supposed to be about regeneration of Lancing yet it includes several questions about the BHA proposal and developing the Strategic Gap. Surely these are two separate issues. If he wants to know the views of people about the BHA application he only needs to visit the Adur Planning website to find out. There is also the issue that Adur Council is currently developing a new Development Framework Plan (Local Plan). When this is complete in a couple of months it will be put forward for FULL public consultation. That is the correct vehicle to seek public opinion about any changes to current policies concerning public open spaces and strategic gap. Not a poll purporting to be about Lancing Regeneration. Methinks that perhaps someone might be a tad concerned about the growing opposition to the BHA plan!

The cryproforest is also battered and paltry, a cheap undefined green that is not a forest, not a garden, not even a park, but give it half a chance and it will take over everywhere where humans retreat. The urbanism of the future is the cryptoforestation of derelict properties, abandoned carparks and never developed building sites. In this respect the economic crisis is on our side. Occupy communities are working toward it from the other end, and when the
The last presentation was held by Jenny ter Horst, a teacher at the Hogeschool of Amsterdam. This presentation was about future cities. She asked us all kind of things: what we liked about our own hometowns, what we didn’t liked and how we thought future cities will look like. Of course we don’t know for sure but by looking at trends and predict how they will look like made us think for a fitting campaign for Amsterdam. For example, we could do something with the ‘green’ trend which is very popular right now and probably will be in the future.
So I’m 6 for 7 consecutive attempts at Rocky. Not bad, given a “normal” 70% finish rate. So I’m still ahead of the odds. But in my mind, it just makes this year’s Rocky a 40-mile social training run. Last year’s painful debacle was different. Even though it was the most painful 100-miler that I’ve ever experienced (to date), I knew that I wasn’t doing any damage that would’ve kept me from running for very long. That’s why I persevered.
Mono red is all about one drops, and this is the king of them all. Automatic 4 damage on turn one. Playing 4 of these and 4 Thunderous Wrath will make quick work of the opponent. He’ll definitely be in this deck.

The other morning at the only surviving bookstore in this part of town, ready to be persuaded despite the histrionic title that I really needed to have the latest book by a well-known decorator, an erstwhile favorite of mine, and someone, I'm sure, nominated tastemaker and trend-setter many times over. I wasn't going to buy the book then and there because, being willing to defer gratification by a few days, I intended to order it online. In the end, though, after going through the book twice, I decided not to buy it at all. When a book, to my eye, is nothing more than a series of vignette after déshabille vignette, I find, much to my and undoubtedly the Celt's relief, that I no longer can be persuaded that I really need a book for its potential historical value, especially when, disconcertingly, I hear myself saying I might not live long enough for it to become history.
Operating with almost impunity, these pirates, joined by local criminal elements and fishermen who see the possibilities of making a quick million dollars, have been encouraged to continue with their criminal activities by the shipping companies who are only too keen to pay the large ransoms the pirates demand in order to secure the release of their vessels, crews and cargo. Whereas it is hoped that the shipping companies will do everything in their power to effect the release of their crews who man their ships - and the cargo they have been entrusted with - what about the ships? Do some shipping companies really want their ships back?

Upon our return to Germany, we let a little part of our German dream die, and decided to rent.
If this was an isolated incident, I'd just think: "Oh, that poor women is so determined, she'll keep her routine, even with a chafed whutsit", but that's not the situation. I've seen this a few times in the last few months, so I'm beginning to think I'm in the dark about something.
This used to be lots of fun in the Gardenweb perennial forum; gardeners would shock each other by revealing the plants they really can’t stand, regardless of said plants' popularity and virtuous habits. In a comment to my last post, Laurie nominates Echinacea (coneflower) and Autumn Joy sedum. I couldn’t agree more. Coneflower does look like a diseased daisy and Autumn Joy is just plain hidjous. Yet, you see both of these everywhere—usually in large groups. The Autumn Joy is tolerated because it blooms at a difficult time, I guess. But I’m not even sure if I would call what it produces a flower. I would suggest that people are much better off loading up on long-blooming annuals and self-seeders like (my favorite) Verbena boniarensis. Japanese anemone is a gorgeous late summer/fall flower, a gazelle to AJ’s warthog, though it’s not all that easy to grow. (They do very well with it in England.)
The new ordinance states specifically that it is unlawful if the host fails to take reasonable steps to prevent possession or consumption by the underage person.
He assures that the people who “beg” for the fish leftovers are Greeks. In the majority old. Pensioners.
Secondly, I use the term 'done' loosely, only because there is a lot of knit-picky finish work to be done. The hardware would all be installed, but the company we got our cabinets from needs to send us several new drawers due to differences in drawer height. Those drawers are on their way this week, thankfully. Also, we need to add the toe kick, fill nail holes, add trim pieces to the island, and seal the marble back splash one more time.
The conclusion came from data collected on almost 900,000 men and women, mostly from Europe and North America.

McQuaid: He has to decide what to do with
I waited around and talked with other folks and watched to see one friend come in from the 1oK. When I left, I stopped by the table to see the postings for the 5K. My final time was 31:14, but I was sure the counter was wrong since it listed that I was the 19th runner in. I chalked that up to technology and just went home. When I checked the web site posting later, I was amazed. I finished first in my age group (50 -59) and was 19th across the line of 97. So, not just a PR, but a win as well. That was still hard to believe. My preacher had also finished first in his age group. And, for the naysayers, we weren’t the only ones in the division either.
The picture for Chile includes a transition of leading causes of death along with an accelerated decline of fertility and delayed motherhood. Koch explained that direct causes –those directly attributable to pregnancy condition– were the rule before 1990, but from then, indirect causes –ie. non-obstetric chronic conditions such as hypertension and diabetes among others– rise as the most prevalent, hindering the decline on maternal mortality.

Yes, a time, I feel sure, when Che Guevara, Trotsky and Marx stared out from the walls of thousands of dirty bedsits, these avatars of an ideology and political practice in every way as abhorrent as fascism. More abhorrent, if the calculus of death plays any part in the assessment of such things. One respondent to the Bright article makes the same point;
Marketer Converge Conference,
The government always promise a bunch of employment opportunities, and to be fair, they really do. But offering jobs locally is just one side of the story. The other side is actually regarding to what happens after having the job— commodities, shelter, family, education, and a whole lot of expenditures which brutally slaps us on our faces saying our wages cannot attend to all of those.

10. The King's Speech - Okay
I encourage all to have a go!
Why is it that we don’t come seeking life instead of more information and knowledge? Why don’t we come seeking Christ instead of other things? Organic church is really only about one thing – the Lord Jesus Christ Himself! It’s about His life and living by His life with a group of believers. How could it be about anything else?
Poor Stephen fears for his life every time he gets in the passangers seat..
I hear voices of other family members in the next room. laughing, arguing , debating and packing. They are ready to leave. Voices from a distance sound strangely mysterious. I try to catch the words as they drift through the thin walls and dark corridor. My caretaker too is set to leave. She continuously reports how others are irked and exasperated by my decision to stay and wait. Wait for someone to fulfill a promise.

It was about 3pm when an excited Shankar arrived at the station. The station ‘office’ was little bigger than a wardrobe. The ‘platform’ was just a barb wired area. Behind the office room was his ‘quarter’, a little bit bigger. After dropping him off, the train left for Kisumu.
Although most of us probably think that sweatshops no longer exist, every cheap piece of clothing that we buy probably came from one. It wasn't until I read the novel Girl in Translation by Jean Kwok that I understood what goes on in such places. There used to be a "sweatshop" not far from my studio. This place was off limits so to speak - marked by heavy doors with Chinese characters - from which tired and sweaty workers emerged covered with fibres and still wearing dust masks over their faces. I never really gave it much thought until I read this book...
Why am I musing on this stuff? Well, recent events, really.

I have a published poetry book. I’m also leading a series of spiritual awareness intuitive workshop with an Australian friend of mine who’s lived in Egypt for about ten years.
I have read that, with the winds from the right directions, the waters in a tributary of the Red Sea, apparently, really do separate and it is possible, briefly, to literally walk across the sea bed from one side to the other. Something which seems utterly impossible does happen naturally – though very very rarely.
“Excitotoxins have been found to dramatically promote cancer growth and metastasis. In fact, one aspartame researcher noticed that, when cancer cells were exposed to aspartame, they became more mobile … “
What this comes down to is a thorough re-working of the 'pro-life' agenda to expand it and make it pro-development and pro-health with both of those being proactive concerns from the need to remove the horrors of abortion. When the major excuses and reasons NOT to follow the SCOTUS decision are removed and the decision enforced, in full, with the full regulatory authority of States and localities, the issue of 'privacy' for those of the age of consent can be maintained while the custodial accountability (particularly of courts stepping in with children against abusive parents in this venue) can be sustained. By putting the courts on hook for their decision about minors and families in the way of judges stepping in, those judges then become accountable actors in the abortion situation and should be addressed and treated as such.

She’s not wrong. Well-meant nudges and winks can feel like pushing and shoving when you’re having a bad day, and it’s difficult to know how to handle gentle, unsolicited encouragement. Smile and nod? Confess to having difficulties conceiving a child and joke about asking the Credit Union for a loan to buy one instead? I’ve always been open and honest about my fertility issues with anyone who’s asked, but that’s harder to maintain when you have a partner and his feelings to consider and the dogs on the street are asking when you’re planning on popping one out because they heard you got hitched a while back. I’m still getting used to the idea that we have fertility issues, not just me. Though it’s of no small comfort to realise that he’s thought of it that way from the get-go. What a mighty good man.

Agua de panela tastes like a mix of brown sugar and molasses. Here, it is made on the stove with boiled water. In the bottom of the mug, you may find a surprise – a big chunk of soft cheese that is pulled out in long strings and eaten with a spoon. It’s similar to the way they drink hot chocolate – with cheese. Panela is also used in baking, as a sweetener for coffee and a variety of other things. It is healthier than purified white sugar contains some essential vitamins and minerals.

In the fifth of the five essays that comprise Anti-Systemic Movements, professors Arrighi, Hopkins and Wallerstein argued that the events of 1848 and 1968 constitute the “only two world revolutions” (authors’ emphasis). Finding strong parallels between 1848 and 1968, the authors situate 1848 as an uprising seeking to fulfill the original hopes and overcome the limitations of the French Revolution, and overturn the counter-revolutions of 1815. The uprisings in 1968, they argued, sought to fulfill the original hopes and overcome the limitations of the Russian Revolution, and overturn the counter-revolutions of 1945, when the United States firmly established its world hegemony. They wrote:

Filipinos are mostly brown skinned, but there are a variety of shades from mocha light brown, to sunbathed dark brown, to almost black but not enough to look like African ebony. There are even some Filipinos who look almost like fair-skinned foreigners because they have fair-skinned ancestors. Our colonial masters, the Americans, the Spaniards, and the Japanese, are nations where the fairer ones were once, or, in certain respects, still remain, dominant, powerful, and privileged.

Pet shops in Korea sell not only pet fishes but also pet birds. Those pet shops are usually called 'aquarium'. The vogue irony of pet birds in an aquarium is similar to our musical identity that unaligned with any particular genre. So we named us 'Aquibird', which means birds in aquarium.
Here are some cute ideas of last minute things you can do for Valentine's Day.
I have now been in Morocco for three days, but it feels like it’s been at least a month. The 40 of us Peace Corps Trainees (PCTs) are staying at a youth center near downtown Fes with a great group of PC staff members, both American and Moroccan. Most of our time is spent in various trainings and language class so we haven’t had much of an opportunity yet to explore the city or meet many Moroccans outside of the staff, but that will come. We have gotten trainings in health, safety, security, Peace Corps policies and expectations, and some discussion about Islam, Moroccan history and politics.

I left Bath at 1100 and deposited my car at Ken’s house in Bristol, then we RV’d with Guy near Avonmouth and headed up the M5 to Cannock to pick up Neil. The drive up was easy, if long, but a pit stop at the side of Loch Lomond at a very well stocked pub revived us!

After several years of our annual Easter shopping spree (care of our generous grandparents), I have learned a few things that help make the process easier and more successful. Trust me, we've whittled down the trip from 4+ hours to 2 hours (I know this sounds ridiculous, but think about five girls selecting and trying on 15-20 pieces each and then deciding on five items each to take home).
Funny that I can spend half a day dreaming about what I will say in my next blog post and when I finally arrive at that much anticipated moment, my brain wants to look up baby animals on YouTube instead?

Off-the-shoulder interviews tend to have quite a different feel to tripod/pedestal interviews. They are less formal, less restricted, and involve more movement. Because the participants are usually standing or moving around, the impression is given of being “up and about” rather than sitting sedately in a studio setting. Indeed, off-the-shoulder cameras are sometimes used in studio settings to achieve this effect.

We’re still talking about work right? Can I tell you how many people don’t understand a debit card vs. a credit card? I’ll offer a customer a credit card and they’ll say, “I already have one”. I’ll ask who it’s through and they’ll reply, “with you.” No you don’t. That’s a debit card for withdrawing money from your account via an ATM or Point of Sale. “but it says Visa”. I have to explain further… and sometimes even further. These are probably the descendants of the people who thought that as long as they have checks, they have money in the account.

The record came out in 1988, and seriously? Only 100 copies pressed? That seems like a waste but maybe records were cheaper to press back then? I saw this record for sale at the Underground and didn't buy a copy because I knew I had it recorded on tape at home. I won that round! Released by Chapter III Records in Arizona in 1988. At that time I was a junior at Eldorado High School. I lived across the street from the entrance to EHS at 1114 Linn Lane. My front lawn was the smoking section. That was a lifetime ago.

I have a new mini-obsession - vintage mug shot photos. Kind of weird I know...

Because all French parents look after their children financially (food, accommodation, cinema tickets, trips to Subway, holidays, new clothes, pocket money, etc) until they are 32, you could be 18, or you could be 23: the CROUS don't care. They want to know what your parents earn. If your parents are poor enough, you could be eligible for a grant. Only if you're French though. You can still be eligible if you're an EU citizen, but you need to prove your parents have been working here in France for 2 years. So basically - not very many of us foreigners are going to get the gift of government aid during our stay here in this delightful country. Which means that I am extremely lucky with this room.

I was at another blog I follow earlier where they spoke of giving yourself permission to do this or that when it gets a little scary when you write and wonder about things. Giving yourself permission to relax, maybe take a walk, get away from the manuscript for a while, helps me. I think we writers put too much pressure on ourselves when it comes to getting something done. Deadlines and so forth. If they work for you. Fine. But if you feel as though you've driven yourself into a wall. Stop it. Give yourself permission to sit back and not write but have a little fun.
Phase two starts tomorrow. A reorganisation of my days to take the best possible advantage of time every day. Andrea has agreed to let me start taking classes every day, five days a week. Mondays I'm booked for a full day, two classes with a one hour break for lunch, from ten am to five pm. Tuesday to Friday, I'm in class in the mornings and working in the afternoon, either at home or at the office, and then working an extra day on Saturday. Work has kindly allowed me to shift my work week over one day, to go Tuesday to Saturday. We've been needing someone to monitor the world on Saturdays, so this will work out well for LSN too.

Wow, it’s December already, and there’s still so much left to talk about regarding the 2011 season. Several events left to review and some outstanding performances to look at. And I’m going to try to get to as much as I can before the clock turns to 2012.

There are now 153,000 books that are Prime Eligible compared to about 65,000 in January. Not all of those are in the KDP Select program, but for simplicity sake let's say the number of books eligible for a Select free run has doubled since the first of the year and posit that there are now twice as many books being offered free as there were then. If all the books being made free on a given day were being downloaded equally, then it should take roughly half the number of downloads now than it did in January to reach a given rank. But that's not what we're seeing. We're seeing it take the same number of downloads to hit a given rank even though there are almost twice as many books available.
Just now he took the Spawn off my hands for a bit, so I could have a break. He then asked "okay, so what's the plan?" Plan?

I folded the clothes. I'll do dishes with him in a bit. I'll get on the sorting of the bathroom boxes at some point, just not right now. Right now I am having me a Spawn-free moment.

Breitbart was so hated by the left that rumors surfaced that he might have been murdered. I myself considered the possibility that, in an attempt to embarass Breitbart, his enemies might have drugged his drink, which might have resulted in his death. But in all likelihood Breitbart, who lived hard and relentlessly in all areas of his life and in fact never slowed down, was a literal heart attack waiting to happen, suffering as he did from a bad heart.
