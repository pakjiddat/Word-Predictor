i am living my favorite chicken story we now have our first flock they are five days old as i write this of buff

these simple acts help us to become more balanced and to live in the present and also serve to alleviate much of the immediate stress

wrapped up quicker than we expected which was very welcome news i had an idea late last week that he would be finished early and that i would be able to pick him up sunday afternoon

in the winter of the year there is a video going around the where a father admonishes his daughter for complaining about her chores on
in the video the father reads the daughters post and then answers her concerns
now i know if this video is a fake or not but i do want to say a couple of things about the dad
he claims to be in i
he fixes computers for a living yet he is wearing some kind of indiana jones type hat
he gives the entire speech from an adirondack chair in a nondescript grassy area
i mention this because i assume that most computer do not own adirondack chairs nor have access to the outdoors
i do not mention this to pick out flaws
lord knows we are all flawed
this is a requirement for a human being
however this dad as if memorized something and cant quite remember it like auditioning for a high school play
he shoots his daughters computer with a gun
really that a bit much perhaps taking a sledge hammer to it was a little too reminiscent of the movie office i cant help feeling that a man who owns an adirondack chair an australian hat and a is not only not a dad but also not an information technology employee
i could be wrong
after all this is america land where people will shoot guns at

in the cold arctic the animals had just come through a harrowing winter
in less than a year some of them would be migrating to better lands
no one knows this but the real reason the animals stayed in the arctic was to test their endurance
once an animal was judged to have passed its test it was free to take off
every year there were different routes for the animals who had passed the test
a wagon came once at the beginning of each winter and dropped them off wherever they wanted to go
they could also go to other places around the world if they felt they wanted to endure a different climate
for this they had to talk to their cousins and friends in far off places and enquire as to the availability of space in their environment
all that however is irrelevant here
this is the story of love duty and loss in the harsh cold north

sometimes i am overwhelmed when i consider that we have missed the first two years of our daughters life

but two years we have missed so much

most businesses mission statements are as slack and glib as most brands positioning statements controversial maybe but true nonetheless
it is entirely appropriate to link the two because they are of course really the same thing
each aims to capture the distinctive benefit and character of an entity and express it in a way that people will find it relevant
it is true that a mission statement is much more of an inward facing concept than a brand positioning and may never be communicated externally
but through acting as the guiding light for a business and its employees and as the banner they march behind it should inform everything the company does and therefore become manifest in its in relation to the outside world
but after going through this its easier to see the reason why

the kinds of economic and issues surrounding virtual archives are not the ones that concerned scholars working in the age
instead for those professors and graduate students the main economic issues consisted of having the funds and time needed to travel to the archives
while travel expenses remain legitimate needs today access to commercial subscription databases funds to support ones own digital projects and the feasibility of on such a project for scholars have emerged as pressing economic concerns
similarly in the past academic libraries created and maintained archives for users admittedly often with some faculty consultation and collaboration
yet today more and more professors graduate students and even some advanced undergraduates not only use archives but they also build them and must plan for their management growth and as well
in doing so many enter into collaborative with libraries while others form part of an academic center devoted to digital work
some digital archives aim to reach more than an academic audience and instead afford a space for public humanities
and in almost all cases our experiences working with sometimes archives cannot help but color our forays into traditional archives
yet what ed has deemed database as genre the epic transformation of archives and other theoretical of archives are subjects for a post

this may be surprising to some but i am not opposed to the idea of banning children from certain restaurants
before you start thinking that lost my mind let me explain
i do not agree with the practice of banning children in any way shape or form but i feel like it is that business owners right to set the rules for establishment
if he wants to make it then i think he should have that right
however i think it is a very slippery
also by banning my kids you are essentially banning families and i cant imagine that would be good for business
my biggest issue with the concept is this where does the banning end we had rules and laws like this at a point in time and it was called segregation

excerpt the battle of athens was much more than an extended gunfight between political factions
historian dan daley wrote it was a violent but decisive clash of two social and political cultures between the past and the future of rural state and ultimately the federal government and a of the deeply ideal that americans can assert themselves against tyranny even when it was taking place in their own backyard
this is an interesting look at a bit of american history id never heard before

there is really little difference between and legal executives now that the restriction on becoming a partner has been lifted
however legal executives may be in practice by not having qualified through the traditional channels in much the same way as from new universities are not usually given the same opportunities as those from the institutions

ok i was reading article about makeup and celebrities into and i was so excited to see something other than the stars without makeup articles you see floating around
i know that those shocking articles are supposed to make us feel better about ourselves but why if the intention is to show that stars look normal when not being with concealer and fine
everyone should definitely be aware that celebrities have a team of people to make them look their best
but is that the real intention so often it seems to be to join in on comments of how looks without makeup
that just perpetuating the cycle of unrealistic body image issues if were looking at those photos and saying gross man she should have put on some makeup we giving permission to the makeup artists photographers and photo editors to make them into someone not were giving them permission to create a false image that promotes dangerously unrealistic expectations about the size shape and color we should be the way we should age and the way our clothing should fit
were giving them and ourselves permission to those people because after all thats what they signed up for anyway
were saying that we want to see them as real human beings and were also saying that were not good enough as is either

brief digression number three some sources incorrectly count that as an official victory including the southern conference record book with the league still listing the citadel as having lost a conference record straight games during this time period the record is for consecutive losses against all opponents not consecutive conference losses
however during that era schools were allowed to count games against military bases and aau teams as part of their overall record
the ncaa actually changed its record book a few years ago to take out references to the game losing streak the mistake had been made long ago and fixed until
the actual losing streak was games

shortly after diagnosis my was going through old letters and correspondences that belonged to her mother my grandmother
among them was a letter about my grandmothers first cousin
he was a priest that served as a missionary in chile from until his death in at age
by all accounts he was a humble and incredible man ministering to the poor and needy in his community by bicycle almost up until the day he died
there were funeral masses said on his behalf just to accommodate his mourners
recently for reasons not quite sure his body was to be buried in a different location
it was then that it was noted that his body was still perfectly preserved many in his community are regarding this as a miracle and are seeking to have him into sainthood to have him officially recognized by the vatican as a saint
part of the process involves documented miracles as defined by the first definition above
without any further thought on the matter we immediately began praying for
joseph to on our behalf and on behalf of this little baby a specific prayer was written out in the letter to put forward when praying for a miracle
i the oldest person there you may read my and think i was once i am now getting on for but where i was sitting everyone was around the age and they all had and year
thats lovely i looked at peoples photos and heard all the funny stories but my year old costs and my year paper rounds really fair to tell in case they scare easy
much better for them to think their children still are genii cant be to how to spell it correct it by yourself and will never give them a moments worry
i had my children earlier than most people not quite documentary early but a good decade before the people at dinner
i did feel a bit out of step with the rest
champions evaluate themselves their lives and their growth consistently
nothing happens by accident
growth must be monitored or it would not occur at all
to be deliberate about the books i read the seminars or courses i attend and determine ahead of time what the would be for me and enforce that personally
what new thing will you be learning what do you have to or where are you deficient and need to improve these are questions you have to answer if you desire meaningful growth
we did have a few problems with mr and although with his help and lots of mails back and forth things seemed to improve with you being able to link up a few of you still had problems so i can only

we held her and walked around the complex knocking on doors trying to find her or dad
she had a bright green collar so she had to have parents right if she did we find them

good thing we picked up a pack of tuna with our groceries
working class beers probably grow out of the old days when there were more local brewers who catered to the local working folk
i believe that situation is coming back into vogue in places like oregon and colorado and perhaps parts of california
local working men and women latch onto a particular local brand of thats made by the or in town or just down the road
these are truly working class beers in the original sense
i think where the disconnect comes is when a leaves its neighborhood and receives wider it becomes too much of a novelty in the other places where its offered
you cant be working class rare and quirky at the same time and though id promised to leave price out of this discussion you definitely cant be all those things and expensive
my first project is a birthday card for my niece personalized with a big bright on the front

i think part of it has to do with our complete with community and family
we live an anonymous existence that allows us to write things on the or hurl insults from a speeding car without any fear of retribution
we are free to air our hurts and perhaps hoping that if we spew it from our bodies it will somehow heal us
sort of like throwing trash on the ground get rid of it and its no longer my problem
but it heal it go away it just gets worse
the longer i stayed here they kept me here i learned about myself what it means to be an american indian
looked through all the submissions and to tell you the truth i cant pick just a few
everyone who joined in a challenge during may
you are getting an image
of course the truth is inflammatory but instead of trying to shoot the messenger he should be stamping out and exterminating the moslem drug gangs who use the huge sums of money to fund terrorism
really not quite sure
the trigger was that i was going to the winchester writers conference and i wanted to enter some of their competitions
i cant remember why but i decided to have a go at one which asked for the first words and synopsis of a novel
as i jotted down ideas the voice of anna the heroine of coping with came into my head and started telling me about her twin sister
all i could do was write down what she said
i know this probably sounds fanciful but it really did feel like that
i had no idea when i started what the plot was going to be
connection to the fur trade and native americans stretches back to its founding by fur trader alexander the son of a fur trader and a dakota woman
traded with native americans in the area
later he would be involved in negotiating land treaties between the government and the dakota

the journey of having a child is an amazing incredible gift from god that i feel fortunate enough to have experienced not once but twice
moving into the second and third books she is forced into hiding for killing the head of a religion and through mystical events finds herself pregnant
she spends a great many chapters about in this place of isolation and establishing that he is the father of this child through some sort of immaculate conception
pregnant and in love in hiding and seclusion is highly frustrating to read or believe and it seems to me that there is not a lot of continuity with her personality from before
i suppose this is some sort of representation of a personal transformation underway
i kept trying to draw parallels between her and her hiding away as a metaphorical but i found myself largely annoyed with her and her musings and obsessions
she became not much more than a self for a large part of the book
this guy then turns around and says that he did these things to defend norway against and
wow when are people going to let these two groups off the hook have been persecuted along with other groups since the dark ages and continue to be the target of and discrimination because of a relatively small few who carry out terrorist attacks in name of allah the compassionate the merciful
have been the target of vitriol worldwide and very specifically in the united states since the communist revolution in and throughout the th century as countries throughout the world tried their hands at or socialism they get lumped in as the same ideology despite their differences
although i must say that all countries that have been described as communist have not actually followed through with vision to the endpoint and have instead all in the dictatorship of the proletariat stage with the communist party becoming a de facto dictator with the head of the party as the head of the state

as a small aside in the century clement greenberg helped articulate the theory of medium specificity which is all about syntactic art
greenberg believed that art cannot truthfully relate anything other than an exploration of the medium it has been made with
this caused films such as andy empire which is an hour recording of the empire state building
time is specific to the medium of film which makes this a prime example of syntactic art
a prime example of semantic art would be any landscape or still life or portrait anything that represents reality

i have another plan if this one fails always have a backup plan
when i think about the interplay between and religion i imagine that religion is the fence the boundaries that give us freedom to explore true
or in the words of the psalm knowing god is the fence the protective barrier that allows us to be still
our son william needed a fence the bars of his crib in order to sleep and those crib bars were good for him
of course those bars only served their purpose as long as there was a mattress
without a mattress crib bars would be a terrible way of forcing him into an incredibly uncomfortable position in which being still was even more impossible than ever before
religion without is as uncomfortable and as a crib with no mattress
but without religion offers freedom without security
we need to understand how to develop both and religion how to be still and how to know god
gave this opinion
instead of proclaiming christ to the europe responds to the phenomenon of islam which takes religion seriously with a reinforced religious relativism says
this is a defensive position which contained the seeds of a declaration of bankruptcy

the exhibition was at the magical i knew a number of the artists were attending this exhibition and i decided it would be a great chance to meet up with them
i had never been to vienna and so it was the perfect opportunity
however i was in two minds as i had never left my year old son for more than a night and the thought of not seeing him for a few days was completely heart wrenching to me
i have to admit that i cried on the train to just thinking about that
i fought the urge to jump from the train and run home to him and i made it to vienna
it was late friday when i arrived and i took the chance to walk around this beautiful city

before you think a complete pessimist i should concede that i think its possible that people can change
but this kind of change hardly ever happens
the average person will not see a truly changed person in their lifetime
i think that something huge has to happen to inspire change in someone
it needs to be something that alters the fabric of their life so deeply that they completely reevaluate everything
sadly i think that some people really believe that gone through this kind of transformation only to realize months or even years later that they are back to where they started
it just stick

i really appreciate it
i love the herald sun and it loves me as can be seen by all the recipes it gives me for foods i eat from cooking shows i watch and the articles it shows me about people i neither know nor care about doing things i have never heard about before with other people i know even less about
since i care much what happens in the rest of the world anyway it really is the paper for me

jesus said to them bring some of the fish you just caught
so simon peter went over and dragged the net ashore full of one hundred large fish
even though there were so many the net was not torn
jesus said to them come have breakfast
and none of the disciples dared to ask him who are you because they realized it was the lord
jesus came over and took the bread and gave it to them and in like manner the fish

for your hair treat your hair with honey and olive oil
honey is packed with and has the power to seal in moisture
before your hair add a mixture of honey and extra olive oil to your hair
if the mixture is to sticky to work with add a little more olive oil or some water
equally distribute mixture throughout hair and then cover with a shower cap for thirty minutes
rinse out and then shampoo and condition as usual
hair will be noticeably softer and
this works great with natural hair especially if you are having trouble with keeping in the moisture

he created this whole fantasy of a coup that would lead to a lasting peace for his world
a quote from the article that really intrigued me was how innovation never comes from the established institutions its always a graduate student or a crazy person or somebody with a great vision

scotland on sunday had a long piece yesterday titled the drink problem
this discussed minimum unit pricing of alcohol as a means of limiting binge drinking and associated social problems
there that much new in it and of course it was mainly about the internal politicking that accompanies such things
one thing struck me about it though

for cider it is
the unit price over a bar is currently

sometimes when talking about the jewish bible you have perhaps stumbled on the expressions written torah and torah
while the written torah is our bible the torah was an old tradition going back to the time of moses
the word was spread from mouth to mouth because there were no chance to write it down
later on from around
the torah was written down and compiled into something we call
and now begins an interesting time in history where and scribes wrote down commentaries and discussions that they held between in different kinds of subjects
soon expanded in size so the next few centuries additional commentaries were written down in jerusalem and in babylon
the two of jerusalem and babylon was born together with is called talmud
probably heard that name before in different contexts not least in discussions about conspiracy theories and but there is nothing mysterious about this

they were going to overcome these hardships together

he then commanded them to visit their relatives and preach the truth that jesus christ was the salvation of the world
with the darkness and earthquakes too many people were converted and believed after the crucifixion
all of this took place roughly hour after jesus died on the cross

they merely reentered their bodies temporarily to fulfill the command of jesus
afterwards their souls again left their bodies

lila although beautiful and the only female villain so far in the six seasons she had a dark side
dexter meets lila in a recovery meeting that he attends in an attempt to cover up his story about framing and sending back to jail for good
lila initially comes off as quirky and to both dexter and the viewers but as the season progresses we come to find out she is an obsessive bent on having dexter to herself
lila rack up the body count that some of the other villains do but she goes after and her kids and takes down the fiery all in the name of protecting and keeping dexter

shepard receives a communication call from hackett telling her that nothing is happening with the crucible and it must be something on her end

a space elevator emerges from underneath her body and floats up to the ceiling
shepard comes to and is greeted by what fans have the god child
the god child being declares the catalyst or the citadel itself and the are his creation
shepard learns that the were created in an attempt to keep organic life from wiping out synthetic life every years because apparently and synthetics are incapable of coexisting together
this mass of races is the god answer to restore order and balance in the galaxy
to be honest this explanation confused the out of me as i tried to follow the conversation going on between my shepard and this glowing blue kid
nonetheless a white man in a business suit at dusk in a racially tense neighborhood under a national spotlight is wise not to ask too many questions of angry black people on the street
better to return in broad daylight
but the composite picture from white witnesses about what happened last saturday night leaves almost no doubt that racial played the major role in the vicious beating
their account perhaps but told quietly and with obvious sincerity follows

in one of the climactic scenes near the end a house is surrounded by a bunch of swat types with long guns equipped with electronic sights lasers and probably night vision
the antagonist bursts from the house with a hostage and the swat guys let off bullets as if it was a scene in the trenches of
the unbelievable thing was that they seem to hit anything but the bushes around the two characters
the antagonist then runs back inside the house and the swat team peppers the door as if now that they cant see him anymore they have a better chance of hitting him
not a great shot and even i can can hit a inch circle at yards with a rifle
i said in my review of divergent that it was complex and clever
i also said that you had no idea where things were going to go
insurgent has both these elements but takes them to a whole new level
whereas divergent focussed on more than the society after erudite put the dauntless under the attack simulation and all but destroyed the faction insurgent focuses on both and the society they now all live in
a society filled with chaos danger and the threat of war
and in a world where factions are kept separate you have no idea what any will do or what the consequences will be
you are constantly sitting on the edge of your seat while reading this book

so it was true
wed heard at home about massive appearing in the city the extensive underground structures succumbing and collapsing from the stress of the disaster and lack of maintenance

communications were patchy and infrequent mostly word of mouth and

leadership is really about developing and inspiring the people
when i sat down and thought about this startling development i realized it is because so much of the fiction i read these days is gritty its edgy its dark and even if a story ends hopefully and even if it is beautifully written and most are there is just so much stuff going on in the novels that they are enough to make me want to claw my eyes out

carefully it was divided into districts one for their brethren who had helped them escape from one for followers of the light central to their people and one for the traders and the creators those who could craft and make the items they needed to live where one could trade their wares for other goods and services
not to mention the great hall they had put together for their visitor with its spiral upwards to the inn where most of their allies would stay
those that lived in the city usually stayed in the living accommodations in the various other tiers in small nooks and that could serve as more private rooms in the generally open layout of the ship

leo who i consider my mentor is the one who first encouraged me to start
i remember a conversation with him where i asked him how you would evaluate a performance
he told me that for a regular seeing the best dancers pleased would be a good indicator while for a festival or a workshop the visiting reactions would be the gauge
at first this struck me as a very approach although i say anything
but its the way been since i started
the rationale was that keeping the best dancers on the floor would make others follow suit
now i really agree with him that from the perspective of a at the risk of being perceived as and an one has to cater to the best dancers demands whether or not explicit which in most cases not unlike others
not the other way around catering to the masses who in a way are because of a vicious circle started with negligent organizers who are only chasing their share of the pie rather than really promoting tango although this is arguable as with all vicious circles

rarely a day goes by when i hear about in the news but all of those news reports are related to the violence that claims the lives of thousands of people in the city each year
though that too is a narrative that cannot and should not be ignored it seems that reports of news have been subsumed by those related to the drug wars
because of that last fact i am all the more grateful that this book was published

i just changed them and it reminded me of this idea from the book the happiness project that the days are long but the years are short
incidentally i really liked the happiness project
i had heard of it but i have picked it up except that my local book club chose it as their book for november
funny is that i really liked it like took notes which i never do planning my own happiness project liked it
and the rest of the group the people who chose to read it like it
in fact several of them really disliked it
its so funny i like this group but i am often with them

because there often that much difference in salary between someone who has gone to college for years and someone who has many people see the point of college if they can simply get a fun job that pays well

most books focus on how to get a child to change their behavior offering rewards or punishments based on a ability and willingness to modify who they are to fit parental expectations and requirements
books are purchased because parents want to control their children change a behavior change their sleep patters get a child to complete their often boring irrelevant too hard or too easy homework without complaining or do more chores around the house with less nagging and effort on the part of the parent
books are written to meet the desires of the parents who want to be easier they are not written to meet the needs of children
generally these books written to show parents how to support their children in into the amazing person they were born to be and they generally do the opposite they instruct parents in how to create children who will some day be and have no clue what it is they love to do
children who will see a quote on that says change so people will like you
be yourself and the right people will love the real you and the words will speak to that part of them that was squashed down and hidden away plus years before
and chances are as much as a small voice inside of then says yes that another small voice will be saying but what if i show the world who i am and no one loves the real me and that small voice is the child who was shut down who learned to do what they were told and to be who they were supposed to be so that they were worthy of love the child who was told that drawing dancing taking apart a motor or playing a video game was a waste of time and who became an expert at being who the adults in their life wanted them to be so that they get in trouble and they disappoint
or maybe they and they were labeled a problem child strong willed or perhaps even given a diagnosis and to make them be who their parents or the school system wanted them to be
maybe they lived their childhood feeling ashamed angry or misunderstood

i know many highly educated muslim friends and i asked them the same question
they also confused but i never tried to push this any farther because i did not want to shake their faith
sometimes it amaze me to see their faith
their faith is so strong and beautiful may be that is the reason that religious extremists manipulate them so easy
on the other hand i do question everything
neither bible nor koran can make me believe just because something was written in there
it has to make me understand
it mean i believe in god
i do believe in higher power most people call him god and he had helped me many times
if i do anything in the name of god or religion then it has to agree with my heart
i am not ready to harm any living thing just because of someone offered me virgins
i mean where is the fun having someone hand over girls
i like to work for it
i like go to my favorite bar and sit in a corner and stare at the girl i like not knowing what to do

poverty overlaps and relates to the next aesthetic characteristic of simplicity
we also see simplicity in verse
the form itself exhibits simplicity
by simplicity we mean that a does not have a flavor of complexity or elaborateness
it is not hard to get and it is very ordinary in its words which are not fancy or unusual or requiring a special education to understand
should not seem sophisticated
we should not think of a city dweller going to plays and art galleries and parties instead we should think of a farmer or of a hermit in the woods or of a dweller in a simple house with a garden in a small town

many things have changed since then but the ritual of opening a bottle of boulevard wheat or pale ale has remained the same
until now
boulevard has switched from to caps and while it may take some time for this change to work its way through boulevards distribution system some day soon all boulevard will require a bottle opener
today was day of for field trips and we found ourselves back in pittsburgh

is a small vegetarian steam table indian spot in culver city where you can get good indian food at a great price
for a mere you get to choose one of two one of three breads and three main dishes from the steam table along with a small salad and
there must be a dozen main dishes to choose from and they change with some frequency the labels on the steam table seem to change somewhat less often so it helps to ask what the dishes are
the day i was there i tried a nice dish in cashew sauce with corn and a lentil dish
all of it was nicely spiced though not too hot and tasty
good food at a great price is hard to beat

as you can see i had to do this lesson for two classes so i just the chart around
since the new assessments use paraphrasing for summarizing i changed my method of teaching plot
before on the students could be taught to find the summary by finding specific sentences within the text
not anymore
so i teach the students that in most stories the beginning of the summary should stop after the problem the middle should stop after the and the end includes the resolution and conclusion
we used this chart along with our story to come up with a summary
i had the students change the first two sentences around in their final copy
here is our class summary and some examples of student work

that was me in front of the tv thursday night when i found out this weeks person of interest was a old girl
i suppose i just wanted to see a poi version of the classic who shot mr
burns episode of the but instead we got a good solid episode that continues to apply tension to the bonds that hold our heroic quartet after this week including lionel together
plus since all this weeks poi can do is eat sleep crawl and herself we get some three men and a baby type comedy as well as a few heartfelt moments out of uncle reese and uncle finch
this weekend was my daughters last regular season soccer game
it was a very tough game
they were definitely by their opponents
my daughter played in the goal for the second half of the game
it was brutal to watch as goal after goal was made
i turned around to look at my husband who always stands behind me and he had disappeared
he had walked down to the end of the field where was to offer support
i know if he said anything
a soft spoken guy
but he was there watching right where his daughter could see him
there are some debates that seem to have been going from the first time i was aware of contemporary poetry
where are the black and asian poets i wonder whenever i see a grouping of young poets they seem absent has or has the relative success of the performance poem created its own separate world possibly the same goes for explicitly gay and poets then again the british and irish poem of the window seems primarily concerned with self but not in a way more in the anecdotal or the
in a world one sees poetry that is often as narrow as or the being that the narrowness is a trick that the poems universality can be found in the of subject as it can be in the poetry of a recluse from amherst
in terms of form a certain formal free verse has been de for so long now that one is almost surprised when something tighter or looser strays into the pages of poetry review
then again now is the first time in the uk at least were seeing poets who have consistently been through the of the or ma programs often run by that previous generations poets a process that started a decade or so earlier with ma fiction courses
we shot these photos at the beach today and he was totally comfortable in it despite the fact that he is popping out the top
i wish id taken a photo of him in it when he was younger
just for fun you know
in any case the show delivered and it delivered good
i admit that it might not be cup of tea my roommate sold
but i can find very little to complain about
the story lines and scenes are awkward and and they actually talk about things year old women talk about
as much as i love new girl nothing about the show is realistic or all that besides the fact that perhaps a lot of us ladies understand her awkward so its kind of nice to see a show where you necessarily promised a happy ending or at least the happy ending is as tenuous and uncertain as all of ours are
i have a job a good job

the majority of our trading time will be when the market is not trending up or down

i attended jeanette event at the royal exchange and reported my impressions here
what else i went to the cinema and saw we need to talk about kevin the book of which i have always found hard to get into
i decided it was a of conflicting and psychological theories cold mothers create monster children or maybe they monster children are born like that macho fathers create monster children or maybe etc
maybe autism was involved or maybe not the test for autism was laughably mistaken child psych john tells me and far too heavy on the blood symbolism which i found as horrifying as the violence they made a point of not showing
i guess i should really read the book now in case the film do it justice
i bet it wont take long for them to fight through the crowd as cole already starts with the twitter garbage
how long till discovers and starts using that i just understand michael cole sometimes he attacks people then calls them a legend is he supposed to be schizophrenic were a minute in and already using the lead pipe thats not a good sign for the match
take long for them to wind up in the crowd as the brawl their way through the fans
no other falls count anywhere match can tough the one between kevin sullivan and chris from years ago that was a classic besides id rather have dusty rhodes on commentary over booker or

the fight their way to the stage and kane into the metal structure that makes up the entrance
goes for the but kane shoves him off and randy runs into a big boot getting kane a near fall
booker claims this match alone is worth the price of admission well maybe if
now fought their way into the backstage area and we see lots of people just standing around and tosses kane though a door

now they begin their long journey back to the ring nice of randy to agree to go back to the ring with kane
hits the and then goes after a steel chair which he drives into the ribs of kane
kane gets set up on the table and hits the elevated on the floor that move just looks so contrived it exposes the business in a bad way
kane sends randy into the steel post and gets another near fall as kane throws randy back in the ring and goes for the flying lariat but him on the top rope
hits a shades of his dad but get the win after what was his fathers finisher
goes into the dance and goes for the but kane blocks and for a near fall
kane sets up the chair and goes for the tombstone on the chair but counters and hits the for the win
the best brawl but considering who was in the match was as good as can be done
their match on raw was the best of the three match series
sad that this was falls count anywhere and the match ended in the ring

someone remembering our birthday anniversary celebrating a graduation sending a card of well wishes or a thank you card
this easter we experienced that power as people came to celebrate the risen lord together after the services i had lots of conversations with new folks and i counted that told me they had been personally invited by someone here at good shepherd

the first half or so of this cassette appears to be a cry for help but i mean this in the sense that anyone or anything needs help
the abstract sounds created by the recorder and a of indistinguishable electronic trinkets appear to emerge from a deserted island of sorts
the clicks bumps loops drones human voices and bass tones all underscored for the first ten minutes by a constant state of electronic panic never seem to reach any grounding or final destination
the first half in sum is an uncertain and sparse call composed of choppy signals sometimes human sometimes not but always
the first part of the latter half half here is defined simply by time the piece itself has no obvious starts or stops never mind halves quarters etc
however sees these sounds reaching the mainland for the first time a dark somewhat hopeful ambient where the panic subsides even if temporarily before a sense of uncertainty takes over again around the minute mark or around the time when a human joins us again for a few seconds only to disappear rather

some months ago i was particularly intrigued by this superb mid coat offered at
interestingly it had been first by holt the same store selling it now some years ago
apart from this fascinating historic detail the coat in itself is an exemplary piece of the type that connoisseurs and of fashion admire
typically in the and a few select pieces of were brought in and promoted by top retailers such as and in the united states in london and creeds and holt in canada
they were often featured in illustrated full page newspaper ads and would create an exclusive buzz while demonstrating a trend or theme for the season that was available in the stores less expensive lines
sometimes a example was reproduced as at a much lower price but with a certain of having the design reproduced or adapted from an exclusive paris model
i read a verse this weekend that id like to share
i hunt putting myself through great physical and mental strain for jobs that i usually want
then i must go before a complete stranger grovel and humiliate myself and beg to him trying to justify my existence to convince him that i deserve to be alive to have food clothing shelter health care and leisure
if the stranger hears my then i am condemned for a period to his particular form of punishment in which he may grant a few of my requests and provide for a few of my needs

i have to admit though that when i was younger i used to envy the kids who would throw parties in school or invite me and my brother to a for their celebration
i have always wanted to have one too until i grew up a few more birthdays later
i also started to find it weird to celebrate something that you have always tried to hide or lied about
first a belief that all pagans both of european and of contemporary tribal peoples represented a religious expression of ignorance and savagery
i wonder if this is a reference to my first days at the center when i said i would swarm low like a bee and collapse on the floor and sleep for an hour or two
i am tired today like i was then
tired and hot with sun on my face and my shoulders
i have to clean the kitchen floor before i go to bed

johnny cash was a master singer of country folk and gospel music whose sincerity and shared convictions with the common man appealed to a huge group of people
if cash was a musical billy graham bringing in large numbers of music lovers to his shows then right now is just a small time itinerant tent preacher scuffling to add a few more converts and barely having enough gas money to reach the next town
what johnny does have is the gift and a few more tales of his own still to tell

a prior engagement kept me away from saturdays game so i have relied on the first hand accounts of those present at park on saturday morning to piece this report together
ryan hurst was first to reply to my text message
he too was unable to play although his absence rather unfortunately was due to an ankle injury he sustained in wednesdays game with sporting bishops waltham
this meant we were without our first choice halve pairing against league opponents as was also missing having torn a shoulder muscle on wednesday
although text confirm the final score it did heavily imply that we had lost we battled well but so many playing out of position
but was very much the operative word and after some coaxing hurst did confirm that we had lost the game
although what was rather more telling was that we were three goals down in the opening three minutes
still a bit iffy with how the bedroom looks i cant decide if its because we have enough pieces to hang or if we arrange the room properly we arranged it whereas some friends have said we should have put our bed next to the window and not opposite it

if you have trusted jesus christ as savior and have turned your life over to him acknowledging him as lord over your life then you can experience gods presence and hear his voice
it takes spending time in his word meditating on it praying over it and praying about everything that concerns you and to seek his will about those things
also learning to get on my knees before god and just spend time being quiet before him
it easy at first but the more able to do this the more able to clear my mind of all other voices so listening for only gods
beginning to experience more and more of gods peace and the sense of his presence with me

craig decided that he want anything with me after realizing that i did
i was stressed out and tired of waiting for mr
and maybe i was being hypocritical considering the idea of having with someone i barely knew but i let the concept of my virginity get out of control
it was something that i was self conscious about
i was constraining myself with rules and i was holding myself back from going with the flow and letting things develop naturally with someone i was seeing
i was too focused on getting to the relationship part of the courtship and guys could just smell my desperation and they would run in the other direction

television has a hold on football like never before
sky has led the way particularly in england and the fees they pay to clubs in the are like monopoly money
the and to a lesser extent are also aboard the gravy train and coverage of the national game on the small screen has never been greater
now we want to go back to the quite ridiculous situation of several decades ago when the scottish football association would prevent terrestrial television channels in scotland showing a european cup quarter final live because were playing east in a bottom of the league clash and therefore the attendance of three men and a dog might be affected to the extent just the dog turned up
however a modicum of common sense surely has to be applied here

in a country like japan which has yet to develop an interest in allowing mass immigration from the developing world citizenship group membership in the japanese nation is remarkably
to be japanese is to be a member of that ethnic linguistic and cultural community located on the japanese archipelago
though it is possible in principle to obtain japanese citizenship it is extremely difficult and and will not result in one being thought of as japanese by the japanese
why not because one would simply not be japanese irrespective of government or media propaganda to the contrary propaganda which does not exist
this state of affairs in which the conditions for citizenship are universally agreed upon by group members and not undergoing attempts at revision can be likened to a stable currency
in japan japanese citizenship is a solid gold coin its value unquestioned in social transactions

you paint in on like regular polish and then let it cure under a lamp for a couple of minutes
you do this about times base coat coats of color and a top coat and after the last round under the lamp your nails are completely dry
like dig around in your purse and be fine
the polish adds just a bit of thickness to your nails just enough to help keep my nails from breaking and tearing but much thinner than acrylic nails are

it is odd that we have spent so much time and energy focusing on easter
my bosses christian

basically my school has us doing all these things because its what they think people in the states do
and while everything we have done is what i would consider the fluff of easter the easter eggs and easter baskets and easter candy i cant help but be drawn back to the heart of what easter really is
every time my students ask me what easter is i want to sit them down and tell them how awesome of a day it is a day on which we were redeemed and saved and bought and freed
but how could you possibly explain that to a who even familiar with who jesus is it breaks my heart that these little children have never been introduce to gods greatness grace love and mercy
and so when i hear the question miss kendall what is easter i do my best to stumble through an explanation suitable for who have no familiarity with

the chapter on enid lyons demonstrates this
joe lyons in his early thirties and minister of education asks out a on a date
they had a happy marriage so its forgiven in hindsight but there are good reasons why if peter garrett asked a sixteen year old employee of his department to meet him secretly on a beach wed ask for his resignation
the are also completely wrong on their treatment of economic and their methods only make them worse
enid herself fought to prevent women gaining i believe
these things make enid lyons a horrible villain of a person but by excluding her flaws the author her biography out
then inside the settings manager and specifically inside the invoked method we do something like
here are a couple of peaks at the quilt
this one is taken as i was machining the binding on

he points out that the message is that people are sinful they must repent and believe on christ and that it will be costly to follow him
while sharing the good news we must communicate the urgency of their need for jesus as well as explaining that all of the sacrifice involved in being a disciple of christ will be worthwhile
we must base our appeals on scripture and ultimately leave the results up to god as our efforts are bathed in prayer

the goal of raising children and instructing them is not get them to be more moral
our children are monsters on the inside from conception
they learn to sin
they come out of the primed and ready and they cannot learn to not sin
our children like us are broken mirrors that need to be put back together in order to reflect his image
this cannot happen unless jesus the true image of god is seen and embraced as the only redeemer
at times people change after we have completed our work with them we may never know the positive influence of our work

there seems to be two thoughts about writing erotica
one that the story should hold together even if there any and two that the must be such an integral part of the story that it will fall apart without the
i subscribe to the second theory because it holds true for any scene it must be a scene rather than simply a of
this means the scene must advance the story tell us more about the characters show us how having changed the hero or show a change in the relationship between the participants
so many authors seem to have the attitude that they need to arbitrarily insert a scene into the story but such scenes need to be written in response to the demands of the story not just because its time to insert a scene

which furthers stereotypes more to discuss the ideas that summers put forward or to assume that young women are so fragile that they cannot even hear alternative viewpoints to assume that they cannot differentiate between someone saying that women as a whole are less likely to be for scientific careers and someone saying that they individually are not cut out for it

i would like to point out my sheer and utter horror at how much they destroyed voice through
his singing on glee remotely close to how low and his actual voice is
just so were clear
look heres the envelope
just something about authoritative stern male characters that gets me all
maybe i have a daddy complex
maybe a year old woman trapped in a year body
grandma lived about an hour south of us
one time my aunt who lived two doors down from us made the trek to see her
for some reason my mother did not go with her
a few days later was speaking with granny on the phone
i was home from college for a bit and it was christmas time and the doctor had an opening
they said that if i have an infection and if the doctor could fit me in they would do the surgery
i was praying my family was praying and my church was praying
at the last minute i got the call that i would be having the surgery
i was so excited that i did a little dance on top of my bed and then i proceeded to praise god for the goodness that he had brought into my life
currently home to ghost a musical based on a film
appeared for us to pore over and cut out and paste into our
i am sure my parents went out to dinner all over the place
there must have been a reception at government house to which i invited
what i do remember most clearly was the coronation picnic
or maybe its always been that way what are bush people you ask
the best part of being a parent in my experience has been watching my daughter learn new things and us all being proud of her
her turning to giggles when she first rolled over
you battled bravely beside your new wife
she said things about gay marriage and civil being unnatural
it was just a really and heavily biased presentation
our small sales table we sold very little over the weekend just not enough visitors sales are not our main reason for being there though however even the objective of promoting an interest in and getting the nursery known cannot be very effectively fulfilled without folk to see the and to hopefully be enlightened a little with some words about the subject
i sit down tonight to write before going to bed
i know in the morning the meaning and urgency will be less skewed and possibly unclear
i might just miss an opportunity to write
so often i hear my heart whisper write but i do not find myself in front of the computer often enough
tonight is different
i recognize and honor that the heart has something to say
i honor it by making time
no warnings or watches issued for wv va nc or oh

when i finally was able to return to school my darling first graders were so excited
i was so glad to be there as well
it felt as if everything was right with the world

no problem
some of us were drinking keg others cask some both
just as at social media weeks tasting a few months ago people are capable of enjoying the products of different brewing traditions without getting their knickers in a twist
will had an excellent piece on the independent website last week which really hit the nail on the head about going on in scotland and not just saying that because he quoted me in it
scottish brewers and drinkers are developing closer ties based on respect and a love of good
suddenly its the sectarian cult that looks and irrelevant
everyone else is getting on great and having a good time
and also check out their page to read more about their products and what type of materials they use such as the corn they use inside their plush toys and that their natural is made of corn as well

i actually told one girl who showed up for her scheduled interview that i had filled the that morning
why was i so harsh she showed up with kid in tow
in torn jeans
wearing flip flops which i could write a book on the atrocities that is the flip flop and brown hair with red tips
sorry this is a hotel not a beach party
dress appropriately
and find a babysitter for an hour
if you cannot find a babysitter for an hour so you can interview for a job i am going to have the impression whether it is valid or not that you will have a hard time finding a babysitter to care for your child when you need to be here at work
so ta ta for now
this is my ultimate tip
its so good i saved it until last
follow someone on twitter and more than likely get an saying is now following you on twitter
then you them about your band
so see that you do actually at least pretend to care about what you think
then you can reply them saying just you or something and they might follow you back
then when they see you on their remember you and be a nice subtle reminder of your music
it goes without saying that people are more likely to help you out if they like you so send them the occasional reply or send them a barrage of asking if reviewed your music
it was really beautiful
i got a nice view no tall person right in front of me
it was only an hour for the service and a couple hours for the reception
they had the reception at a ski hill

wondering as a how hard this will be on my children and family

i think probably a moral in there somewhere for him about sharing with his sister too
i obviously count that as work
what counts as real work is a sensitive issue for me and not just because of the gender thing
what really rubs me the wrong way is when people insist that the arts count as work that writing count as work that anything you get paid for count as work
the was technically his since he bought it with his money so its fine if he wanted to destroy it
the dad said she bought it with her money so really it belonged to her
oh well actually it matter anyway because legally anything a child owns belongs to the parents
it was still his to destroy
yeah and where did she get the money to buy a if she have a job it must have been her fathers money
therefore it belongs to him
you see it is convenient at the start to assume the father had bought the for his daughter because that makes it easy for people to
for me the challenges fall in the longer series
for me i have to rely heavily on notes in order to remember how things played out in previous books so i write anything that would lend to a discrepancy

go on over to her page and check them out
linda and her daughter lisa had brought their to the grand opening weekend at all about ewe a couple of months ago
i took a pamphlet and to be honest stayed away from her table of yarn and goods sigh
anyway i found out that one of the ways you can donate to the sanctuary is to agree to prepare and spin up fleece then send it back to them so they can sell it
all proceeds go right back into the animals and their upkeep and medical expenses
as a bonus she will send you some for your own use
my spinning friends you cant beat that deal because getting at least as much as what sending back to them
its a great way to practice and fine tune your craft while not actually using your own fiber
for myself grateful to be given the opportunity to help out these animals we love so much for their fleece while getting the opportunity to spin stuff i never did before
my intention with this is to document my progress and the creation of whatever yarn which chooses to reveal itself
this is what i received in the mail

this the third adaptation from warner
of classic san francisco mystery in just years is clearly the best though the first version now dangerous female and starring ricardo as a slightly incarnation of sam is well worth as a tougher less romantic version of the story

often the lord asks us take steps that confound all human logic
additionally he often asks us for our very best and many times he asks us for something given us previously the fulfillment of a promise

the same is true with species
the definition of a species is a group of animals that can produce fertile offspring
but what of species that can produce offspring they sort of half the same species part of a whole but even more importantly i once read about this type of lizard with a large range north to south
beginning at the southernmost place they live each lizard can produce fertile offspring from any other lizard within a certain distance
but the southernmost and northernmost lizards cannot produce fertile offspring together
at which point does it become a different species where do you mark the difference

rev after this i saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth holding back the four winds of the earth to prevent any wind from blowing on the land or on the sea or on any tree
then i saw another angel coming up from the east having the seal of the living god
he called out in a loud voice to the four angels who had been given power to harm the land and the sea do not harm the land or the sea or the trees until we put a seal on the foreheads of the servants of our god
then i heard the number of those who were sealed from all the tribes of israel

a fun thing to do when you do in fact encounter these cliches is to think of ways you can reinvent them
for instance instead of fog as thick as pea soup consider fog as thick as milk left on the counter for three days or fog as thick as pond or fog as thick as aunt cold cream that worked as well as shed hoped it would
instead of thinking outside the box you go with thinking outside the kiddie pool or thinking outside the congressional hearing
changing up a cliche is a fun play on the familiar and makes you look very clever

because the conventions of social media have not been set for me it is all the more important that employers in particular the public sector set firm but common sense guidance

amongst the perfect legal possibilities is the formation of a family corporation or trust in which the assets pass into the hands of the company with each family member becoming a director of the company

ben is unfortunately leaving us at the end of the month to take an attending position at chop hospital of philadelphia
as most of you know dr
ben has been with max since the beginning of his fellowship
max was only weeks old when we met dr
little did we know that on july we would meet one of the doctors that would not only make a huge impact on our lives with his bedside manner and easy going personality but we had just met someone who was going to have a huge part in saving our sons life
ben never made a decision about care without confronting tim or i to ask our opinion
if we were unsure of something ben would be there to answer any of our questions and if he know the answer he afraid to say so
if he hear from us after a couple of weeks he would call or us just to check in and make sure everything was still going well
he went out of his way to come to the dialysis unit every time max was there for a treatment to make sure he was doing well and to see if we needed anything
he came in on his day off once because something unexpected happened to max
guys these are just a handful of the things that he did for us as a fellow
can you imagine what kind of attending he is going to be dr
ben is going to be one of the best attending doctors that chop has ever seen
we are so devastated that we going to be apart of it but we are overjoyed that we got him for the three years of his fellowship
as as it is to lose a doctor like him we have traded the time that we have gotten with him
he got max tim and i through the hardest years of our lives
its impossible to repay someone for saving your sons life
all we can do is take comfort in the fact that what dr
ben learned in his three years of being fellow will help him in saving another life and that is enough to put us at peace with him leaving
ben you will never be replaced and will be missed greatly
remember that you are always welcome to come back

the original price was
now why i did now buy the other one i know it was to small but my thinking cap was askew and i thing about the material in the dress being used another way for all sorts of ideas
of course i have kicked myself several times and now try not to think about the thing i did of not picking up stuff for the materials to be used
before the ten days were up i felt like we were gypsies running up and down the highway from blinkers to cities like ft
as the time grew less and less i began to pack my treasures and trash and stash of goodies and found that i had a car full

thus armed he could set out to right the terrible wrongs done to him by the church and society

meteor crater was a highlight as well as the towns of holbrook all the classic on the mother road
we drove through sun snow rain and everything

i could understand more about what she needs and what would help her to learn

and my needs a break from incidents praying that my flight to chicago is smooth uneventful

my flight to texas started out in virginia at am flying to chicago first
i had the worst on the plane so midway i woke up to take a few
to be exact and leaned back to go back to sleep
woke up about later feeling slightly odd yes odder than usual and and knew something right figured i was either getting a bad or a sinus infection
so i leaned down to take another just in case
when to my horror i realized i had taken maximum strength instead
oh drugs me
like stumbling drool on my self drug me
ok not pretty at all
and they hit me like a brick
i literally was like a
slurring my words and stumbling
i stumbled up the gangplank to exit the plane in chicago and i could barely walk people
i hubby to say i think i made an
a big one
well not really surprised much by me after years so his response in typical james form we call well ok as long as you are somewhere safe be ok
did you hear me
i am and its not pretty
but i guess i was in an airport that suddenly i was contained and safe to him
not suzanne thought getting on the people movers to her next gate would be helpful
less walking right right yeah i put my small tote on the people mover for whatever reason it made me dizzy and i lost my balance
i did the splits on the people mover
it was not a good site it was not hot or cool in any way ok
and i split my jeans open
where you ask right in my area
did i have clothes in my tote
of course not
that would never be my luck huh and yeah i had red clean ones though that did over my rear on and my jacket did not cover it
so trying to get upright and the guy behind me is trying to help me and i know trying to not laugh and like no no i got this as i stumble off and try to arrange my jacket around my waist in a manner that look like i was trying to cover up something
i get to the gate and sit down the man next to me is
wrong time bud have idea who or what you are talking to right now i think i something like but i am berry and am having sub
he looked at me like he felt badly for me and hey at that point i felt badly for me and figured it was best to sit there and not move or talk until it was time to get on i pretended to be a statue very interested in my phone although i was so sure drool was coming out as my head bobbed up done
so i go and get on plane
oh yeah that was fun
suzanne tripping on the plane and literally running my body down the wall of the gangplank so i fall
i looked special at that point i was lucky to get a window seat in the second row
two guys sit next to me and trying to not make eye contact i look like a
i cover up with my and go to sleep
wake up halfway flight and feel slightly better enough to form somewhat sane sentences
so i asked stewardess for cokes
trust me i really needed about at that point i looked like i did she brought them quickly
the guys next to me start laughing like you have idea buddies so just shut up not in the mood
ends up the guy next to me is a fighter pilot who had traveled home from a tour in afghanistan and had been traveling days yeah made my travel journey not so sad huh
so we were chatting about the military and stuff and the guy on the end joined in
so we are all chatting having a grand time the guy on the end asks me what doing in san antonio and
wants to know if there for the rodeo i wish i have always wanted to go
turns out the guy on the end is joe nichols
the country singer
i recognize him
at all and i yell you liar
you are not
yeah real good suzanne and he pulls out his drivers license sings a line of his song tequila makes her clothes fall off
yeah appropriate song for a girl who has her hanging out of her pants but he was really nice and he signed my country weekly magazine which i just happened to have in my bag no pants but it i have some magazines and invited me to rodeo where he was singing today

rather i am suggesting that you set an expectation and then let your employees know that you meant business you create a rule just to create a rule
you asked them to follow a procedure because you know that it will increase efficiency or alleviate unnecessary stress or simply is just the most effective way to get work done
when you check back you will tell your employees that you care about them following protocol

before i get to the recipe i do want to share that i will be adding a new feature in coming days
part of my absence was due to the new diagnosis that my son is allergic to cows milk
figuring this out has been a true miracle as he has been a completely different child since eliminating milk products from his diet
his digestive system has been completely turned around and the child is now willing to eat regular meals
three years old and for the first time is able to eat normal amounts of food instead of picking as he always had before
the poor thing looked at me the other day and said happy because my hurt anymore
hard to hear from your little one been doing a lot of research trying to find foods that are made without milk products and recipes that fit within his new dietary needs
you believe the items that have milk products in them it truly has been an education one thing that i have found is that it can be very difficult to find recipes
many of the specialty items that you can find locally are incredibly expensive and i have had to learn to make many new items from scratch to control what he does consume
hoping that if i share what i do find and have success with then i might be able to help someone else in a similar situation
learned so much from the and sites that i have found and would love to be able to pass some of that along

ron paul has a libertarian view of the constitution
i do not
the constitution has to be read in the context of another founding document and thats the declaration of independence
our country never was a libertarian idea of radical individualism
we have certain values and principles that are embodied in our country
we have rights
the constitution is not the why of america its the how of america
its the operators manual
its the rules we have to play by to ensure something
and what do we ensure rights
and so to read the constitution as the is in a sense what happened in france
you see during the time of our revolution we had a declaration of independence that said we hold these truths to be that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
so we were founded as a country that had rights that the government had to respect
and with those rights come responsibilities right god did not just give us rights
he gave us a moral code by which to exercise them
see thats what ron paul sort of leaves out
he leaves out rights and responsibilities that we have from god that this constitution is to protect
and he says no we just have rights and then thats it
no we
america is a moral enterprise
my understanding of our founding documents and the purpose of this country is different
i would argue that understanding of the constitution was similar to the french revolution and the french understanding of the constitution
the french had i think constitutions but their constitutions were initially patterned after the american constitution
gave radical freedom like ours does
but their founding document was not the declaration of independence
their founding watchwords were the words liberty and fraternity
but no
no god
it was a completely secular revolution
an revolution
and the root of it was in power rules
now this garnered some commentary from and paul supporters but i happen to agree with and think that what is missing from view of our country and the role of government is any kind of firm moral yes i dare say it religious foundation
granted paul has argued against the war on christmas and has spoken up on this most recent attack on religious freedom but he seem to have any idea how to combat it except by getting government out of the way

then i heard startling news that newport library was going all digital
they would retain their library and activities in addition to a few other services
throughout the day i thought about the ramifications
i considered the implications if all information everywhere was available only digitally and required a power source for the access devices
what if
all power systems ceased to function those individuals retaining memory bank knowledge they could share would be prized elders in every community
we would have come full circle with our early ancestors but would just be on a different level from them
news reported the story was incorrect with the true facts misunderstood
meanwhile an interview with the representative discussing an alarmed australian communique on the change revealed her amazement the library had been receiving these inquiries from all over the world

i think most would agree that the best part of this simulator is simply getting around the environment
the original game had two great where you scaled a prison and the other where you climbed a mammoth tower in the center of the city
both were memorable enjoyable yet still provided a bit of challenge
how is this possible well once again more than one button is used is jump is fly but in the end infamous uses far more context sensitive movement than god of war
hop on an electric wire and zoom across it but if you jump on a sign scale it like a raccoon
yet even with most of the being context sensitive it still manages to be engaging
why because in infamous navigation is like a dance and the better you get at the quicker you traverse obstacles
not only that but much of infamous relies on figuring out how you scale something as opposed to the mechanics
it choosing the route more than completing it
and during sequences where you have little choice such as these the requires precision if not necessarily much timing because the game will not simply shove you into the direction of the next handhold
you can die and fail easily in both of these sections yet restarting is quick and and when you scale either of these massive structures you feel like accomplished something because used everything climbing jumping flying sliding to navigate them

i know about you but when i come across things as i rush around being a working dad that remind me of specific things from when i was a child every time i see a snotty tissue i cant help but remember a gypsy child in the waiting room of royal infirmary putting used tissues from the floor in his mouth but as my own children say yes dad but that was before the war

we glorify god when we magnify and amplify his beauty
psalm says the heavens declare the glory of god
we know how a spectacular sunset can remind us of gods splendor
but why did jesus describe his impending death on the cross as glorification of himself and his father how could such a terrible thing ever be glorious the cross is the ultimate demonstration of gods mercy justice and love all wrapped up into one event
its the place where our sins were forgiven where new life begins
jesus death on the cross magnified and amplified the love of the father
and like a falling drop of water the effect of the cross ripples across history to this day and into eternity

these sheets that been working on are an alloy of gold
you know that many alloys of gold are extremely hard and that some alloys are beautiful in color
this alloy has both gold and uranium in it
the uranium is present in only minute quantities
it is present because of its radioactive properties
this seems to promote the activity i am after
the polishing process which we go through is to cover the sheets of alloy with a thin coat of the colloidal platinum like that i used on the anodes of our machine
i call it because i really know no other name for the particular ray i produce with the machine
the oily liquid we use is a chloroplatinate which i reduce to platinum in the presence of some gaseous reducing agent such as hydrogen or carbon monoxide
this leaves the freed platinum in the state
the oil forms a coating only ten or twenty molecules thick
with the very fine state of division of the platinum we obtain the hazy impression of grey void noticed on the ends of the anodes

during the acoustic set ryan had the misfortune of a string breakage during a song

my mother is demanding i get a job in which i am trying the best i can to get a job but its like no one wants to hire me most likely because still in college today she mentioned she wants me to start looking at jobs that are about thirty minutes away which if thats the case i might as well call the district manager for studios and tell her i want to work at the location over an hour away since it has zero employees

and if my college will cooperate i will only need one more class to graduate with an associates degree
but i really want to stop at just an associates degree i do want to get my bachelors degree and one day even a graduate degree because i enjoy being intelligent and putting it to use
college is just so expensive and not even worth it most of the time and i qualify for any financial aid whatsoever because considered white and my parents make too much money its not a thing with me thats just what counts with the government
because of the fact i qualify for aid i qualify for most scholarships because they require that you show financial need
so basically if i want a degree i either need to work round the clock at a really great paying job or i have to take out student loans
managed to find the student loan of choice one of the student loans that are offered by texas higher education coordinating board
they offer the lowest interest rates you will probably ever manage to see for student loans in your entire life with that low of interest rates offered pretty sure i could manage paying that loan off if i do manage to take one out i just prefer not to take out such a ridiculous amount of money because i simply cannot comprehend anything over

many of the immigrants who entered the new world a century ago surely had their own version of these practices
somehow in the intervening years they have been displaced by modern american values
i certainly wish to idealize either the traditions or their modern counterparts but it is fascinating to note the rate at which cultures and people change or stay the same
while immigrant pockets might still be practicing assisted marriages their peers in origin countries might consider the practice as antiquated as contemporary americans do

something to consider is having two coolers
one for your more critically cooled items like milk and mayonnaise and one for items like brick cheese and ketchup
another thing to consider is that the longer a cooler stays closed the better it retains its cooler temperature
with this in mind it may be best to divide your items according to what will be needed often
items which are rarely needed

a couple interesting developments that have come to my attention since i wrote the piece
one is that charging as much for an as for a may not be as outrageous as i once thought
this piece from digital book world made me reconsider and i certainly favor publishers spending money on important things like author advances editors and marketing
however its one thing to charge or the equivalent of a book
its another to triple the prices for libraries and libraries only like random house has done
their theory seems to be that at libraries is just too easy so more readers will borrow instead of buy but surely they realize from decades of experience with physical books that frequent book borrowers are also frequent book buyers who may well be inclined to snap up a writers or recommend a title to their friends like many librarians i was also unhappy with decision to limit library to per license
some library books fall apart or go missing sooner than that
but others hang around for years and years

the true world but who is it really who tells us that the apparent world must be of less value than the true one does our instinct not contradict this judgment does man not eternally create a fictitious world for himself because he wants a better world than reality above all how do we arrive at the idea that our world is not the true could be that the other world is the apparent one in fact the greeks thought of
a shadow kingdom an apparent existence beside true existence
and finally what gives us the right to posit as it were degrees of reality this is something different from an unknown world it is already a wanting to know something of the unknown the other the unknown good but to say true world means to know something of is the opposite of the assumption of an world

one of the problems with an enforced screen free week is that when you try to control or restrict anything not only are you creating an increase in tension or conflict in your relationship you are also increasing the desirability of the thing you are controlling
think about this in terms of candy
my kids can eat whatever they want whenever they want no restrictions
however many kids live in homes where candy is restricted
my kids may have times when they eat quite a bit of candy but there are other times when they eat any
my kids also have times when they eat a lot of fruit or salads or broccoli and then have times when they eat any of those things either
when kids who have free access to candy come to my house they will eat a whole lot of candy
they will even eat the candy that my kids have decided they like that has been sitting around for ages and they will often stuff a piece or two in their pocket to take home for later before they leave
those kids see candy as being highly desirable because its restricted in their homes
its that age old concept of supply and demand decrease the supply and you increase the demand
i used to hate candy because of the conflict it created in our family but now i have changed so much that i wrote a post entitled i love candy

drew came running in to my bedroom last wednesday to tell me that one of his was loose
i was a little surprised because drew just turned a month ago but sure enough his tooth was pretty loose i pulled so many teeth in the seven years i taught first grade that i am practically a dentist so i felt fairly confident about helping drew with this developmental milestone
to me the key to easy is to let the tooth get very very loose almost falling out on its own before you try to pull it
if you try to pull it before it is loose enough it will be painful
if you are patient you can pull it easily and the child will hardly feel it coming out
i told drew to keep it and that when it was loose enough i would pull it if he wanted me to
he it all evening on wednesday and all day on thursday and by thursday night before bed the tooth was very loose
drew agreed to let me pull it and it popped out easily with no pain
we were all quite excited
but then i take a step back

it all started with a tree
it was a very old tree which had grown from a nut dropped by an even older tree and so on and so on until one might surmise one had reached the ancient of the tree
it was a peculiar and towering tree native to one region of the world later introduced to countless others
the tree was in danger of being struck down and burnt and beloved as it was someone elected to cut it down gracefully
they sawed the trunk into great planks and spread the planks amongst the people who loved the tree
from these planks were made tables

if i can establish as an absolute that the holy ones are going to be in heaven and not on earth then we have a guidepost for correctly understanding the references to kingdom and how it would have to be used in different contexts in order to harmonize with the absolute
that is one of the things that i will be attempting to do in this discussion
i think starting first with the word kingdom is a little cart before the horse since we are informed that the word kingdom can mean two different things the actual government or the domain of that government
unless there is a definitive qualifying statement alongside the use of the word kingdom we will constantly be running into which meaning is it carrying in this context or biblical statement

on the minus side since that first purchase i have gone on to buy shall we say a few more pairs of shoe trees
i now consider them an essential purchase if you care about your shoes
so each time i purchase a shoe i have started to factor in the extra cost of a shoe tree
obviously shoe trees will outlast the shoe so i will have them for many many years to come long after the shoes have worn out
nonetheless they do increase the cost of building a shoe collection though they pay for themselves by enabling shoes to last much longer
initially i intended to use trees only for special more expensive shoes and to alternate between shoes
eventually i have come to the view that it is simpler though more expensive to have shoe trees for each pair of formal shoes

the best news our car ended up qualifying for the recall so they fixed the entire issue completely for free

our individual and very powerful choices have huge consequences for ourselves and our loved ones futures
trading in that big huge monster truck for a more efficient model is like trading in the wood stove for a fan on a hot day
turning off the lights and reducing the temperature in the room is like turning off that hose in the flood
doing these things means we can contribute to a much larger natural bank account for our children in the future when the going gets tough

the first time i walked into old ale house and asked for a bottle of bud was years ago and i was informed that they only sold their own ale

the father of was alternating his story as the idealistic leader of an agricultural commune and as leader the godlike leader of the cult
the background of story were already in the first books
professor one time best friend of and eventually the adopted father of had already recounted parts of the story to while leader himself talked about it to before she killed him
research into the archives of library already provided the general arc of the key incident in book
also the air as read by and described throughout the first books already gave away some of the plot elements
hence it would appear at first that this was another repetition of the story
surprisingly though there were new elements to mine in this story and there were several inconsistencies slight modifications between the versions of events and reality mentioned in the first three books and the events and reality of the present book

i am in year of my year project to build a wardrobe
when i began the project i confess that i did not set out with this as a clear aim
like many men my wardrobe was not near the top of my priority list family career finances were at the top and rightly so
a little over years ago i got round to looking at my wardrobe i that something needed to be done
i certainly have the money simply to replace my wardrobe so it needed to be done bit by bit
with hindsight i now know that this is the best way to build a wardrobe

overall the idea behind the novel was good but takes a very long time getting to the meat of the story
some readers may really like this slower pacing but i am
too fast and little development leaves me yearning for more but too slow and too much development leaves me a tad bored
this novel lends itself to those looking for a good vampire story that slowly develops its characters over the years within the novel
two and a half stars

the next minutes my heart beat on its own
she had the worlds biggest heart and a heart for her family and it was evident there on the monitor
as odd as it seems i stood at the base of her bed and held her foot
i just looked down at her feet and thought of the many i had given her as a little girl and thought of the current day when taylor loved to color her nails

the simple truth is that most agencies make their money off the authors they represent selling everything from representation to critiques to editing services
selling the rights to your book is often an afterthought
if you decide to consider this type of agency which i do not recommend ask the agent a simple question before sending your first payment where has the agency placed works for the authors they represented in the past if the only answer they can give is that they have placed manuscripts with a sister company of the agency you might be better off investing your money elsewhere

i am well aware that jesus was not purposely here giving us his philosophical treatise on human nature
i know that the context is that of prayer and that he was making a comparison by contrasting one extreme with the other all in the attempt to help his audience understand that god answers his prayers
but as often times happens with jesus everything that came out of his mouth was so packed full of truth and can be applied in many different contexts
i believe there is another issue here that is abundantly clear

i want players to doubt their abilities i want them to debate the proper plan of action and i want them to be worried that one or the other of their party going to hold up their end of the bargain
you need a special group of players to do this need players who like the part as much or more than the game part
these players are able to separate their own emotions from the emotions their characters are feeling
they are in it for the story not the reward at the end
when i introduce a conflict that forces their character to make a horrible decision

the poor woman looked unhappy to begin with not the mad kind of unhappy but the nervous unhappy
he walks in with her kind of authoritatively and explains his story to the broker
the broker says the asking the kid gave him of the jewelry was unreasonable and offered a different price
the women put her input in and her boyfriend says you need to shut up and let men handle this
the broker looked shocked and was wondering why he said that
the kid replies to her again just get behind me and shut up
that right there i would tell the kid to get out of my shop and never return
that kind of is completely for and drives me absolutely nuts
what made it worse was when he referred to her as his property when he said i can talk to my property how i want you would talk to your property that way you the key word there was property

grating the apple meant that there were no obvious pieces of apple detectable in the cake

it reminded me very much of a very good banana cake except with the taste of apple where the banana would be

then i decided i might as well take the shower id wanted before i left home
again i wake anyone
i figured the shower would do that but they were all tired and slept through it
but then i was standing there in the bathroom and realized i know where my clothes were so i yelled out the door for steve to get up
he hear me but angie did and she woke him up enough for him to find my clothes
they were all rather surprised to hear that id been up and about for awhile
the scars of the year conflict are everywhere in northern uganda
i walked through internally displaced person camps
i smelled i listened i saw i touched i tasted
i experienced uganda
i saw people whose lives had been radically changed
i placed my hands on a woman whose lips had been cut off by the
i walked with children whose parents had been killed
i sat on the foundation of a hut burned down by the

fifteen minutes what is so complicated about filling a glass from a tap that it takes an hour from after sitting down before i am able to enjoy my friday night cocktail as the arrives i decide to order food as well though i fear it would take at least hours before i even see it
surprisingly it only takes about minutes but the chicken that i ordered was perfection
never has indian food tasted so good which is surprising on many levels here the germans know nothing about making ethnic foods because they know nothing about the magical use of herbs and spices even authentic indian restaurants i have visited have never measured up to the of the food that enjoyed on this evening

this is of course rather obvious stuff certain comedy voices take more time to understand than others but thats how i feel about this is a clever comedy but its one that needs more time before i completely give myself over to its way of thinking

i imagine that many people will say that the are because of the opposition to immigration
conversely i would argue that importing unskilled labour to artificially suppress wages is itself fundamentally
the fact is that politicians have for years brazenly stated that immigrants do the jobs which britons are too lazy to do
the reality is that the wages offered are below the equilibrium or more likely that the benefit system interferes with the labour market

in the beginning of the film a man climbs out of the back of a car and breaks the fourth wall to talk to the viewer about the great movie tradition of no reason he calls it
this means the nonsensical things we overlook due to suspension of in many classic films why characters go to the bathroom for example
apparently that is his excuse for the rest of this film which features again a psychic killer tire after a woman at a cheap motel
there a bit of a divide in magnitude there overlooking not seeing a character go to the bathroom is a world away from overlooking a tire that comes to life for absolutely no reason and kills people with psychic powers
those are very very different things and the fallacy of the movies argument goes right over its own head resulting in a rather humorous effect but not for the reasons the director intended
its more funny in spite of itself
