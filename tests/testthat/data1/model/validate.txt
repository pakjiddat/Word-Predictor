lets take thailand for an example
the portion between men and women in thailand loses the balance and the quantity of female is much more than that of men

and then i watch them as they run to the office and report to the complex manager that just standing outside
they want me to even go outside my door anymore
they want to keep me imprisoned in my apartment

they will never have to experience the pain and memories of the kind of verbal and mental abuse or the physical beatings and abuse i endured at the hands of my perpetrator my mother
well it was in the diary to repeat friday but okay

dear ms
i truly hate this
for the past few weeks i have been having a very difficult time getting to sleep
i lie down with the full intention and desire to sleep but it remains quite elusive
instead burdened with thoughts
lots and lots of thoughts
they just keep coming no sooner am i able to resolve one then another one comes
and if something i forgot to do that i should have i will obsess on it
and i find weird things to obsess on as well
lately i have this bizarre fear that someone will come into our house and us all
yeah i know where the does that come from
son of race i will however describe to thee the island called
this island king is circular and of the form of a wheel
it is covered with rivers and other pieces of water and with mountains looking like masses of clouds and with cities and many delightful provinces
it is also full of trees furnished with flowers and fruits and with crops of diverse kinds and other wealth
and it is surrounded on all sides with the salt ocean
as a person can see his own face in a mirror even so is the island called seen in the lunar disc
two of its parts seem to be a tree while two others look like a large hare
it is surrounded on all sides with an assemblage of every kind of deciduous plants
besides these portions the rest is all water
this prompted yet another decision
with so many choices which charity should i pick staying true to my goal of moving aboard i decided that the chesapeake bay foundation would be my choice
they work for a better environment and for all the creatures living in it

i was thinking of my daffodils while i was at the symphony syracuse concert at the capitol on sunday
many of us know of the troubles that the syracuse symphony went through we all watched them weather the hardships wondering if they too could persevere
listening to the musicians play on sunday with the stan orchestra i knew that they too were like daffodils in many ways
they were perennial providing great concerts year after year
they were plucky the musicians reformed symphony syracuse when the syracuse symphony was dissolved taking a significant pay cut to ensure that audiences in our region continue to enjoy classical and popular music
they also help to make life more beautiful and help us forget our troubles

what was saying stripped of his ornate imagery was that the people of europe in his time no longer believed in the christian and doctrines they claimed to accept and needed to own up to the cult of power that had become their actual religion
that may have been true still its one thing to realize that you no longer believe things you were raised to think were good and right and true its quite another and far more devastating to believe in something with all your heart and have it disproved right in front of your eyes
the religion of progress claims to be justified by works not faith during the three centuries or so of technological expansion the apparent confirmation of the myth gave it immense strength as the age of progress ends and we enter on three centuries or more of technological regress the resulting body to our cultures beliefs and hopes will dominate the cultural psychology of an age

the members of rocky mountain paranormal society while interested even believers in the paranormal do not find evidence of ghosts every single time
they seek phenomena with varying results the same as everybody else
they investigate claims of paranormal or psychic events with the goal of investigating nothing more
if their investigation points to the paranormal they say so if it they explain why it
unlike others in the field they seem perfectly contented with a banal explanation

several decades ago a male researcher did a project in which he gave a bunch of blocks to kindergarten kids and told them to build bridges
the boys built better bridges than did the girls
from this he concluded that boys had a better understanding of the work ethic were more industrious and some other stuff
so a lot of years go by and a female researcher repeats the study but she watches to see what the girls are doing
what she sees is that the girls are a sharing blocks and helping each other
instead of competing they are working together instead of building bridges they are building working relationships

anticipating many tiresome comments about how both these beers are boring and bland made by big corporations and that its a bad thing on tv
my answer to that would be that these beers and these ads are not aimed at people who write and drink in craft bars
were fine we need to be told that real ale is a decent drink or that pubs are nice places to be
no one who is already drinking great craft is going to suddenly start switching to or greene king as a result of these ads
the useful job that big brands can do is bring more novices into ale for the first time and remind people how great pubs are
with nearly being spent advertising real ale over the next few months this is fantastic news for as a whole whatever you choose to drink yourself

this is why there is not only a democracy of objects where every object is on equal footing despite there being hierarchy and inequality among units but also a democracy in objects
in notoriously says that we will never do better than a politician
here is referring not to state leaders though them too but objects or in general
every entity that enters into relations with other entities is a politician insofar as it must navigate the tendencies or singularities of the other entities to which it relates
but not only this
every objects must navigate the units of which it is composed
docile bodies are never a reality but always a dream for some despicable units
the subunits always have their own say and their own aims or tendencies such that every harmony is only provisional
it is for this reason that every unit is fraught with entropy from within
the subunits out of which a unit is composed always threaten to fall apart such that constant activity or operations are required for the unit to continue or endure
but it also follows from this that the units that emerge out of subunits are never simple masters of what they become
the components that compose a smart phone contribute every bit as much to what that smart phone becomes as the engineers that designed the smart phone
the engineers had their idea of how the phone should be composed the parts or subunits had their idea
this is because the structure of the various parts and the tendencies that dwell within their parts go in directions that the engineer must navigate
suddenly the engineers find themselves faced with problems and constraints that make the phone as finished product go in a very different direction than they intended
as a consequence teleology or aims are never fully our own
rather teleology is an emergent feature of a public composed of the humans and in interaction with one another

these particular recordings were made in and by a number of groups mostly drawn from the musicians who played at nicks tavern in greenwich village
what they played was sometimes called as mentioned and sometimes jazz
they were inspired by the early jazz bands such as the original dixieland band and the slightly later new orleans rhythm kings
one of the on this record george was a founder of the latter group
although inspired by earlier groups these players generally employed less collective improvisation and more as is shown on the record at hand
group improvisation is mainly heard on skeleton jangle which was written by the nick

moon and stars filled it but it always remained dark
now the dark even with kisses filled him with a pulsing dread
he had learned that while no monsters lurked under his bed many lurked in the edges of the darkness all too willing to destroy the weak humans

divorce is one of those things like many in saudi arabia which is exceedingly easy for men to obtain but quite difficult for women to achieve
when a saudi man wants a divorce all he is required to do is to simply say i divorce you three times in front of a couple of witnesses male of course
however when a woman initiates the divorce in this country she is required to go through the legal process in court before a male judge and prove her case which may or may not result in her desired outcome
also for the divorce to be granted the woman is almost always required to repay the full amount of the dowry paid to her or her family when she was originally married which could be a considerable amount and even though she may have been married for many years

unlike type where insulin is lacking the primary symptom in is insulin resistance
when food is consumed the carbohydrate is broken down into glucose which circulates in the blood before being used for energy or stored
as blood glucose levels rise insulin is secreted by beta cells in the pancreas and insulin is what facilitates the exit of glucose from the bloodstream
written a post about this before
because people with are resistant to the action of insulin the levels of glucose in the blood remain higher for longer and more insulin is secreted to try and deal with it so levels of insulin are also high

the one tragedy that occurred with this recipe is that the container i held it in broke
it was one of my brand new spice jars from world market
you might have heard about my tough morning on my post but heres the story again i was preparing a pork to go in my and as i was putting the spices away the jar holding this spice mix fell off the shelf and in a freak accident landed on the rim of the then the of my counter and then broke on the
there was a hole in the side of the jar and the spices poured out
at least the pork harmed
i had just finished preparing it and i was afraid it would be ruined by glass but it was totally fine upon my inspection because the jar hit the outer edge of the crock and not the inside rim
thankfully while i was cleaning up the mess i realized that my arm hurt and it was then that i noticed a shard of glass sticking out of my arm
its weird how the mess was pretty well contained in a pile of spice and a few pieces of glass but nothing major yet i still ended up with a cut
i know how that one happened
so to conclude the story i lost my spices and spice jar but i know i will make this mix again because it was delicious i cant wait to sprinkle it on some shrimp and grill them

when after introducing to us the of the vine he went on to teach us that the branch which is separated and as it were from the mother who nourishes it will be wholly useless and doomed to be consumed by fire he thereby terrified his disciples not a little
for awful tidings even though they have no reference to the present are likely to cause no little alarm to their hearers especially when the obscurity of the future engenders the suspicion that what they hear may come to pass
just as the voyager who is about to cross the sea before him when it seems probable that a storm will actually arise and the billows rage and the wild waves lash themselves in fury even though he do not see these things before his eyes and they stand yet merely in expectation and that perhaps baseless fears them as though they were in his sight
he then fitly raises up anew his disciples trembling and struck with terror at these dreadful tidings and by the thought of future trials to a sustained courage and leaving his sad discourse speaks to them of their joy of heart in god
for it is not he says my disciples for this cause that i have now spoken these words unto you to rob your minds of courage or to inspire in you a vague terror nor that you should be found altogether broken down by the thought of evil to come and unable to endure to secure your own but that you might be quite otherwise affected and have pleasure of heart in me and that my joy should abide in you

i tried to leave the yeast in the bottom of the bottle and not in my glass

my husband tells me all the time that i share too much with people i over explain things
i think part of that is me trying to take others guards down and show them not perfect because i wish that i could have a vulnerability with most everyone i care about
i laughingly will tell people embarrassing things about my past or tell them about a lie i told so that i can be open to them in that way
i just wish more people were open to that as well
if we are not willing to be vulnerable to other meaningful people in our lives then when are we going to be comfortable being vulnerable with god

unfortunately i was a bit late and there were already enough contributors
typical me
but the likes my art so she was going to check if i can have some space
and she made it possible
i am so happy excited and a bit scared
because there are some well known artists on this exhibition
so i have to try not to get intimidated and to feel trust in myself

the aim of this project and the resulting code published in april
is to promote transparency and consistency in european copyright law
the members of the group share a concern that the process of copyright law making at the european level lacks transparency and that the voice of academia all too often remains
the group believes that a european copyright code drafted by legal scholars might serve as a model or reference tool for future or unification of copyright at the european level
the members of the group hope that this european copyright code will contribute to the establishment of a body of transparent and consistent copyright law that protects the moral and economic interests of creators while serving the public interest by promoting the production

also once again is portrayed as a beast and simply stands around dancing as mario removes the floor from beneath him sending him crashing to his doom

do not interfere with the processor of memory of at least better than of disk space free you have to run a few tables plus a couple of service programs each of which consumes a lot of resources
the latter is the fashionable room requires a good accelerator
monitor recommended resolution of this is due to the fact that pros usually play multiple tables simultaneously and the usual amount of table fits in just tables with no overlap which is very convenient for the game
a modem is better to replace the highlighted line
in principle of room the speed of the modem enough typically room eats
of traffic per hour but it becomes critical to the quality of the connection again leased line becomes much cheaper and just more convenient

i wrote about a small town in southern ohio that came together around a young man named jake porter
he had fragile syndrome which made learning difficult and he was on the high school football team
on the last game of the season the coach named dave wanted jake to have a moment to remember so he wanted to put jake in the game and let him take a knee
just for the experience
team was losing at the time and so he called timeout and met the opposing coach on the field
everyone saw the opposing coach derek dewitt shake his head no
and then jake went into the game was given the ball was about to take a knee
only then every player on both teams parted and pointed toward the end zone
jake ran for a touchdown
he believed it was the winning touchdown
and there a dry eye in the place

there are two primary areas of mismatch that happen due to the of understanding mathematics
the first is that the teacher is striving for students to have relational understanding but the student is satisfied with instrumental understanding
in other words the teacher wants the student to understand why the problem works but the student just wants to get the right answer
this is more common and probably more evident in the classroom
the second mismatch is that the student wants to understand the problem relationally but the teacher is only teaching instrumentally
in other words the teacher wants the students to repeat the same steps or the same procedure or just follow the rule for each problem
the student wants to understand why or maybe wants to make more connections to other problems but the teacher is limiting that
the that they wrote was plain wicked
what are the levels of participation
in other words thinks that the ear evolved from the ordinary skin in other parts of our bodies and sees our feeling low sounds in our skin as a proof of this

so this leads to the second point what is the process by which inequality is produced to read the many articles which are bothered by inequality one could easily imagine that its produced by a combination of unfair taxation tax dodging and cunning systems of inheritance
its very cheering to see these aspects of inequality being highlighted but they are what they are tricks benefits
they produce the inequality
its quite possible to make an argument for saying they are necessary part of inequality in the sense that this is part of how wealth is salted away hidden conserved within families and the rich class as a whole

when god was dealing with israel as his chosen nation when they needed he sent other nations to bring israel to their knees

so the occupy movement is an expression of a growing realization that we have been trapped in a dead end with our economic system and that we have to begin to create something new

director gordon douglas made a lot of films but he had it in him to produce something of real quality when the conditions were right
rio is among his best movies and only the valiant is another little dark gem tucked away in his due largely to the tough and cynical script and an uncompromising performance by richard boone
to douglas credit the action scenes are extremely well staged and along with cameraman joe macdonald he really makes the most of the rugged utah locations
still its boone that carries it all along playing a mere shell of a man subsisting on hatred and bitterness
his craggy features were ideal for from his iconic paladin in have gun will travel to a couple of memorable appearances as the villain in two john wayne pictures to name just a few
seen it written that his performance is a bit one note but i think thats being entirely fair
one sequence in particular has him showing two vastly different sides to his character within minutes
referring to the scene where the come upon a burned out house containing what one assumes is a tortured violated woman in agony on her deathbed while her infant lies neglected in a cot alongside
we can see a series of emotions playing across face but the predominant one is a deep hurt as the terrible vision obviously brings back memories of the fate of his own wife and child
as he puts the woman out of her misery he is close to breaking down totally the mask of toughness slipping momentarily in the now deserted room
when the raiding party returns to harry the trapped men though boone reverts to type almost instantaneously
there is something terrible in his primal joy the of malicious laughter he expels when watching a downed apache burning to death before his eyes
it could be argued that undergoes a change of heart as the quest progresses seeing that the army mission has some worth in itself that supersedes his own desire for vengeance
again i read it that way
the confrontation with rodriguez seems to me not so much a realization that there are higher issues at stake but more a necessary way of ensuring that his own ambitions are not thwarted

mister cleared his throat introduced himself to the class then announced that he would be permitting each enrollee to offer up one proposed behavioral rule which upon approval by the entire student body would be adopted as official schoolhouse policy for the remainder of that year
everyone seemed quite agreeable to this unusual course of action especially bartholomew figured he could use it to his advantage sometime in the very near future
so each student scribbled their proposal on a small piece of scrap paper and mister collected each of them in an old cigar box
he then read each suggestion aloud as the class voiced either a yea or a nay
every rule was unanimously accepted
even bartholomew rule which was that anyone caught stealing was to receive three stinging blows across the bare back from a willow switch by whomsoever may have fallen victim to said theft
no exceptions

it is a cheering thought that christ can adapt himself to any race or age or people
he will give life and light to any man or woman anywhere in the world regardless of doctrinal emphasis or prevailing religious customs provided that man or woman takes him as he is and trusts him without reservation

also a class component to this story in that the porters pride in his job and his uniform only causes him to be content in his relative poverty
he returns home to a tenement apartment and struts around as though an important and wealthy man but actually a servant with a nice costume and an inflated sense of his position which distracts him from his actual class status
performance is remarkable communicating all this complex emotion and social angst through his body language and his expressive eyes about the only part of his face thats visible behind his ornate hair
when the porter learns of his fall from grace he tries to keep up appearances by stealing back his old uniform but it proves to be not enough
whereas he used to return home with his chest puffed out walking with a regal manner his confidence is shaken now and he skulks into the courtyard hunched over anxiously looking around as though he wants to simply disappear into the shadows
he has to remind himself to stand up straight and try to project confidence but as he walks towards his apartment his slouch returns slowly but surely and soon home past the laughter and disapproval of the neighbors who were once so awed by his seeming dignity

mind chatter is like an inner voice that constantly analyzes everything about our lives surroundings and the people we know

it happens when we gossip or think negative thoughts about others

a tip about using natural sweeteners when it is not desirable to have one prominent flavor in a cookie that needs to have several flavors working in synergy it is a good idea to combine two different natural sweeteners rather than just using one or another
because i added cocoa to this simple drop cookie neither honey nor maple syrup the two sweeteners upon which i most rely is a flavor i really wanted to be prominent to overshadow the chocolate
by combining the two sweeteners in about a ratio neither the maple nor the honey flavors stand out in this cookie but the sweetness all there turning the cocoa into a bunch of goodness that does a fantastic job of enveloping the pop from cranberries

this must have been extremely uncomfortable for cecilia as she usually was very socially introverted and know how to handle the attention
quietly she asks her mother if she can be excused to go upstairs as she can feel all eyes on her wrists and not at all on her
her mother taken aback by this odd request sadly excuses her daughter telling her that she invited everyone over so she have to feel alone
cecilia acknowledges this but is unable to stay
quietly she excuses herself and walks up the stairs through the kitchen up the stairs into her bedroom jumps out of the window and into a fence that surrounded the house

there amongst many other things explains what it means to be a
a sedentary agricultural society
he writes for instance that the problem of defining just what constitutes agriculture is an acute one when examining the of new guinea
traditionally the major crops of the region have been root crops such as or species such as bananas
in order to propagate these plants one simply needs to grub them up cut off the tuber or sucker and stick the leafy top back into the ground
this simple act has probably been a part of the human behavioral repertoire for years or more
clearly it does not qualify a person as an
but what is to be said of the person who returns to the newly established plant occasionally and clears competing species weeds away from it and what if they plant tops together does that qualify as a garden would it do so if they fenced the patch clearly the definition of merges into the definition of and it is impossible to say where one ends and the other begins
this mobile cultivation of the landscape actually helped to generate as goes on to explain a substantial part of our contemporary highly fruit diet
indeed he writes given the extremely long history of agriculture in new guinea it is not surprising that a number of plant foods appear to have originated there
among these are certain varieties of sago some kinds of bananas particularly the cooking or plantain varieties sugar cane and various nuts
some of these crops were adopted by people as far afield as africa asia and the pacific islands many hundreds of years before european colonization of the pacific
new agriculture has thus made an important if largely forgotten contribution to the food crops of the world

supposing truth is a woman what then lars von trier has answered question in this film
nature is the truth and in woman is the embodiment of nature
she is beyond good and evil
mother nature is terrifying if left to her own devices
she requires the repression and sublimation of her forces in order to build civilization and to avoid the reign of chaos
thus man likes woman peaceful but woman is essentially like a cat however well she may have trained herself to seem peaceful nietzsche beyond good and evil aphorism

id worry about complications id think of the worst case scenario
then id tell myself to stop breathe and say a prayer to stop my crazy mind
it was hard in the hospital and been hard moments since and people ask how doing it and i just want to make them understand that it really matter how hard it is the happiness to have it over and done with a great outcome makes any hard day or moment okay
i think even in my wildest hopes and dreams i thought wed be here years ago
she was just considered too weak to survive
everyone goes through hard things
i was just talking to a dear friend today that is going through something hard
completely different but hard nonetheless

the ideas that make it through to the final pitch are so watered down and that it suddenly highlights what the pitch is actually about
this series is a vivid portrait of where personality goes to die a young lady on one of the teams who looks a bit like perry from community and every time she pitches an idea to her boss it comes across with such desperation and is usually followed by a thats funny right as if all she wants is some validation that her time been completely wasted on an idea for an ad involving talking sandwiches
she get it because her boss shuts her down with a look that says i think an idiot and its all incredibly hard to watch

i want to alert you to this ted talk and the challenge that accepted to write out my and blessings for days in a dedicated journal
in this photo you see other big things filling my life right now

did you celebrate when punk won the title from john back in chicago way back when how about when daniel bryan pinned the big show when ryder finally climbed the tower to achieve his first official championship despite his custom made title carrying a lot more weight no pun intended let me make it perfectly clear you can count on one hand how many titles in the big two companies of professional wrestling are worth even a fourth of a

not the first to question insistence on dead wives check out nathaniel awesome dead wives club poster above
but this entry i thinks answers the question why he always has one
an has actually more power in her dead state she is neither bound up in the eternal sleep of zombie jessica and the sleeping snow white nor alive like laura or
she is free to rule the psyche of the male consciousness without worry of clashing with the real thing
in other words unlike dana andrews in laura leo never has to worry about his obsession suddenly coming to life and doing things like taking too long in the bathroom or nagging him about his drinking and intimacy issues
he can just stay up late and guzzle and stare at the photo of her and maybe some dead children smiling into the camera behind the artistically cracked glass of the picture frame on his
this is the ideal state for all lazy males the dead wife allows all the interaction to occur deep down in the dream state so she cant you in front of your friends
good luck with that leo one day a girl will get too close and your whole construct of self will cave in

i had visions of turning into my middle school chorus teacher a woman who used her enormous chest as a writing desk whenever she wrote out a hall pass

psychologists charles bond jr
and bella ran a study and found that lie detection is not about the observer but the
a persons perceived credibility plays a strong role in whether someone judges him or her to be deceptive
thats not necessarily because a person is honest its because they comport themselves in a credible manner
participants in the study more often believed liars with high credibility ratings than who were perceived as low in credibility
when bond and evaluated numerous other studies about deception they realized that individual differences among judges of deception hovered near the same rate as chance
no one appeared to have an innate advantage

and in answer to leslie you are too kind
i often look at those pictures of stars without makeup and think hey thats what i look like without makeup its i just know that to look my best i have to work a little at it
it cracks me up how surprised people are who usually see me without makeup when they see me made up

meanwhile operation continues and when we last saw the family they were down to two chicks meaning another had disappeared overnight
we think the majority of the chicks were taken by the howling storm that hit the south western cape on tuesday night and lasted for two days
it was the worst storm in years had wind speeds that went right off the graph and caused massive flooding and destruction
while the storm raged much to her indignation was kept indoors and today was the first day we moved the guinea pig pen now the guinea fowl pen outdoors and onto the grass
although it stop her from trying to escape shes a much happier little bird for being outside
meanwhile the old dog traveling cage big enough to house a large golden retriever has been pressed into service as the inside guinea house
its high enough to give her space to fly a bit and were trying to encourage her to use her wings
as an aside and working on a hunch also discovered shes particularly partial to freshly made a right piggy of herself it down
the plan is to release her as soon as she has her wings the forays into the garden notwithstanding at a time when her family is here
by comparison to the two remaining chicks remains very small but she is growing
reminded me of a bulldog pup his mum bred some years ago a runt so tiny as to be pathetic yet after a year he grew into the biggest bulldog ever seen

now of course i need to add the disclaimer
were not in another recession just yet it is still too early to tell whether we are at present suffering another downturn
moreover there is nothing to suggest that the current crisis in financial markets is going to continue like it was
markets just might do that but then again they might not
not going to predict how the markets are going to respond over the coming days weeks and months
nevertheless i do think that there is enough evidence to show that another market downturn and another recession are going to happen within the next months and i will stick by that

compared to tiny furniture made when she was only gulp girls is tight and fearless

when david cameron set the review up he made much of the benefits he saw from introducing a fair use right and detected in this an attempt to appear pro innovation without the government having to do much in particular not spend money such as through tax breaks
as plenty of commentators said at the time law would not allow this
has echoed that and dismissed the possibility of a fair use law
instead he has listened and listed a large number of less radical changes government must consider

shame functions as a filter through which we perceive all incoming data
comments or looks or actions by others
things we read
love offered
a kindness rendered
its origins lie in sin
our own sin
the sins of others against us
but as it takes root in our minds it takes even good things offered us and twists them so that they are perceived as assaults against us
as rejections of who we are
shame isolates us because it can even render us incapable of receiving love from others and even from the lord

however i do sometimes stumble upon something new that seems good and worth sharing and one of these good things is annie clark who records under the name st vincent
i have no idea what musical genre she falls into perhaps she falls between several and thats why i never hear her on the radio
her voice is very clear and sweet and her lyrics often verge on the whimsical but shes never something sinister in there too and the arrangements are often strange decked out with grinding guitars and bursts of sudden drama
in a way she reminds me a bit of david lynch that sense of something strange and twisted lurking behind the white picket fences middle america
except that i always found that deeply boring and predictable when david lynch did it and st vincent is never either of those things

she listened to it all
pretty sure there were times when she wished i would just be quiet
as a kid i feel like i fit in with the rest of the crowd and always felt odd so her just listening to me made me feel that there was somewhere i belonged
i remember we would hang out with another family and that would just yell at her children all of the time
everything warranted a yell from her and every time we left i thanked my for not being her

the wealthy often intrude on the processes of politics for their own benefit

our visit to the ministry took longer than expected and we had to move forward our appointments with the swedish national party and the swedish democratic party
the very youthful politicians and activists of the swedish national party are activists who have already dedicated an entire edition of their to the cause with articles about our history the concentration camps the great trek the monument as well as the farm murders and the of eugene
clearly there is at the moment a strong awareness process among swedish youth and we were astonished about the interest they displayed in our country as well as the great many requests for more information

ill be honest the book had a chance with me up until the big reveal
after the big reveal that was anything but just have to trust me it was a flop but i want to spoil the book in my book just continued to go downhill

we managed polite greetings through our surprise as jon continued
many of us have long looked to alternative news sources for the truer picture of what is going on in world events myself included
and there has been much revealed there but it has not included what has been most needed as far as solutions go
this commonality has really caused me to deeply ponder just whose side really on
is it honestly just a matter of not being informed and being deceived themselves or is it all by clever design as brought up several times before are we once again guilty of underestimating our enemies those who truly hate us and their reach think about it
still learning i still battle saying no to bad stuff i have it all together but certainly on my way
not afraid of the murky water at all
what is my plan
yours in the and in theological education
over the past month or so been working with various authors publishers and to coordinate a summer event that i finally get to share with you
in our quest to create an old family tree we ran across many more of these
i really hope that my mother one day completes her book on her fathers side of the family and i hope her good intentions will not be forgotten in the depths of procrastination
i had a great time working on the projects this month and getting to know some of the members of the beading
i also really like my necklace and while i thought it looked nice in the magazine it is not one of the ones i would chosen for myself
so i would have missed out on this wonderful design if i had not joined the beading group
now a picture of the last week a friend of mine shoot

to be freshly pressed is cool
it means that someone somewhere for some reason thinks that what you wrote is relevant witty visually outstanding poignant provocative or any combination but not limited to those nice words
it means your thoughts or product will be posted to be seen by the entire community or at least those who know about it

had to think about this i really collect anything but i do have quite a large paper collection so i guess you could say i collect papers

the house is always a mess and its quite hard for me to handle that since it seems like i am cleaning up all the time
but as my dear nan says
you cant have children without mess
cup or walnuts chopped
it got me thinking why wait
now you need to have a knife towel and hot water next to you for this
take the knife and put it into the hot water for a second then dry it with the towel
carefully score the top layer only chocolate layer
with each score you make you must warm the knife in the water then wipe it clean
it is important to do this so that when you cut into the bar the middle layer of cream out and mess up the whole bar
trust me it works great
the law allowed you build right up to the plot line on your building and then you could rise up to a certain height and then once you reached that height you had to step back and then step back again
there was a formula for how high you could go before you had to set back
the height that you could build up to depended upon the width of the street
on a wide street you could have a street wall that was higher than if you were on a narrow street

a cinema of affects must learn from this it must seeks to suspend knowledge for potential to show viewers the potential for within each and every shot within ever bit of sound and vision
as has said we must feel the pulsing of time in every shot and if we read this through we can say that we need to be able to see the power of pure difference within each shot for difference and becoming not to be confused with more tame forms of time are two sides of the same

sometimes it frustrates me that in our society we are expected to ever get over it
i for sure think it is healthy to dwell on it and let us consume us but largely our and pain make us who we are
to deny it is to deny a part of ourselves
instead of fearing the pain we need to feel it
went to visit jack hess and he was working in his shop on yet another standard
suggested we sit on his patio
for the first time mentioned that now a trustee of the city library association
i said nothing and let it pass
he asked me a lot of questions but i let nothing special come out
exact quote from hess on the board
they want my stuff
he told me how helpful joe was when he first knew him and expressed disgust at the way he turned out
do you smile often
true had fantasy points to on the bench but still i expected more
like at least a touchdown against the arizona cardinals
however avant was the one who really disappointed with his fantasy points and not to be left out of any of this was who ended the afternoon with fantasy points where he was projected to have by of course had a legitimate excuse with two broken ribs
you can hardly blame me for the vagueness
it runs rampant in paris
just look at some kids birthday invitation especially the directions on how to find their apartment once inside the building
fact people will end up disappointing you one way or the other
expectation is the root of all disappointments ergo no expectations no disappointments

i know i am not the only one several of my close friends share the same disorder you know who you are
i have been tired and hello last weekend was thanksgiving but most of all i could swear that i felt fetal movement i know freak so that begs the question is there such a thing as phantom fetal movement syndrome you know like when still feel pain in the limb that was removed its all neurological so it should be feasible that i would still feel movement from my one who was essentially part of me for the better part of a year

of all four movies first contact is the only one i can ever see myself voluntarily sitting through again
even then i am only marginally enthusiastic
i do not feel there is a great sense of finality here even though the fate of several characters is set
why if you are going to send beloved characters off into the sunset do you and the movie over to a director who knows nothing about them it is going to result what we got an unsatisfying movie that limps to the finish line

another kind of contest with a hidden agenda is conducted by publishers
these contests focus on unpublished authors and since entry fees are small or nonexistent and prizes often involve a promise of publication they can seem very attractive

there are a lot of bold insecure and simply selfish people out there today who do not respect other peoples relationships and partners
they usually women will often go out of their way to prove they are desirable by flirting with someone man right in front of them
often times its done for a competitive edge and for ego building
either way it matter what someone else is doing that cannot be controlled to a certain degree its always left up to your partner to show no interest in feeding into that
yes its flattering to be desirable to others whether you are in a relationship or not
but it should not reach levels of outright feeding unless you are the kind of person who depends on others validation to feel completely desirable to your partner
the problem is when a person who is in a relationship feeds into other people who are flirting with them who know they are in a relationship or even better knowing their so is standing right there with them
it is the job of the person in the relationship to halt that in some manner if their partner is being put in an awkward situation

id say for me the best thing to learn was that there are and lows when writing a book and even more on the road to publication and you have to savor the and let them inspire you and let the lows roll off your back
the story starts off with jack as an obvious who starts to date lee lass character
on the first date knocking back whiskey from a bottle in his coat pocket
she a drinker but he gets her on the with a chocolate cocktail
they marry have a kid and both sink a lot of
this leads to her burning down the apartment when and him losing a series of jobs after getting the sack from his executive pr job
at this point i almost turned off
it appeared to me a run of the mill flawed morality tale about weak characters up their lives
the bloke was obviously a controlling to start with she a weak willed dope that should have thought twice about him on the first date
but as i was halfway through i continued
the film got slightly better before falling off a cliff into the realms where it was impossible to suspend
to engage in a film you have to accept what is occurring essentially to believe and engage with the plot even if it involves with aliens with pointy ears
at least temporally for the duration of the film
i could believe the point where jack sees his own reflection in a window decides a and rather than go into the bar he goes home and talks to his wife
i could believe it when they go and live with her dad go on the wagon and life looks up
i liked the bit where he walks into the kitchen and his father in law is having a offers him one and he declines instead going up to his wife to secretly get
at this point the film was subtle in the points it was making and more effective for being so
he then ends up in a straight jacket in a bin and a young quincy from offers him help which he takes
a bin that happened quickly
really the drama fell off a cliff at that point
i accepted early doors that i was watching a morality tale but that for me this was the point where we found out the pointy eared alien was half human begging the question how species from planets can mate when we know that species from the same planet cannot mate even if closely linked in an evolutionary sense
my belief could not be suspended and the film fell apart
quincy saved it slightly as the guy helping our main protagonist with a character that served to narrate the proceedings with his actions
happy saturday all the scale is headed back in the right direction for me

it a few days before i began sitting at the mouth of the old well after performing my ritual
i wanted just to be with the land and its wild life curious about the abundance of those shy and reluctant but always blinking eyes
from the first time i sat at the opening of this well i could sense the presence of our local working in the watery realms directly below me however these were not the ones with the eyes in the woods

throughout the scene the roosevelt the only thing we have to fear is fear itself speech is being read
nonetheless there still seems to persist in some minds the view that two groups as antagonistic as the nazis and the communists or the and the communists just cannot have been ideological
let me therefore try this little quiz who was it who at one stage dismissed as a barbarian a criminal and a was it stalin was it some other communist was it winston churchill was it some other conservative was it one of the social democrats no
it was none other than who later became ally in world war ii
and if any two leaders were ideological those two were
so i think it is clear that antagonism between and others and between and others proves nothing
if anything the antagonism between and other socialists and between and the reds is proof of what typical socialists both and were

a fun challenge
this year i watched in awe as i saw people fill square in cairo and demand a government answerable to them
he is due to give evidence as a witness in the theft trial next week
all resolved come what might to believe anything however preposterous to overlook anything however villainous to approve anything however and brutally authoritarian in order to be able to preserve intact the confident expectation that one of the most thoroughgoing ruthless and ever to exist on earth could be relied on to champion human freedom the brotherhood of man and all the other good causes to which they had dedicated their lives
we then traveled to the local fertilizer and store in order to show us how the farmers purchase their products and how they translate to the us products
we found them to be very similar in fact their main fertilizer for potato production is or
the fertilizer is affordable as the government regulates the cost so that the prices are not driven up on the farmers
in order to sell the fertilizer the manager must have a license and they are trained on how to apply and use the product
the manager then informs the farmers in his area
the manager had found the funds to build his own facility and although it was not done you could see it was a very useful facility for him
he rents land so he can grow potatoes every year thus he needs to have varieties that are safe and stored well
he currently needs one ton per acre of potatoes in order to have a successful crop and the holds tons of potatoes
if still stable in weeks i will stop the now is not a good time for me to fall

the party i enjoyed most recently was my first party in my atlanta home
rogers was in atlanta for the first time so she was guest of honor
i invited forty of my friends in atlanta for a seated dinner
i had five tables of eight and i named each one after a rogers film
one table was top hat one was flying down to rio etc
when my guests arrived each was given a card with the name of his table
then during the evening moved from table to table starting with kitty
they also took the mazda vehicle registration he said
does he look like one of the birds that sang to mary
that is really all that is going on
i am fortunate to be living a story worth telling
it is worth telling because of the people i meet and what they teach me
it is worth telling because of the authentic work that we do and how it can bring real value
it is worth telling because i know all of us are striving to live that kind of life where we can empower and bring more meaning to our existence

throughout our lives if we are fortunate we encounter a number of opportunities to share a loving connection to another human being
for some of us the essential experience we seek is the of sharing of genuine love and affection
for others it is more visceral and temporal in nature with appropriate complementing emotional connections
but every once in a while we experience the perfect storm of love and affection and
it is just this sort of connection that points to the existence of empathy as the quintessential human trait which combines the visceral and temporal with the mysterious and ineffable aspects of our humanity

members will take part in an online vote on these proposals from from midday on december to midday on december
ideally one would hope that the will take the criticism of the proposals on board and try to fix them before we have to vote or at least separate out the controversial bits
if they would voting against these proposals leave the in a fix as has been suggested no because the existing awards constitution which is a pretty robust document allows the committee to introduce changes by a formal vote
the new committee will be able to sift through the wreckage of these proposals and implement the bits that were a good idea having a jury read the and ditch the rest pretty much everything else as far as i can see

when european and us consumers think about what china makes they reflexively turn to basic items such as textiles and toys not necessarily the most innovative products and rarely associated with brand names

but i am not even a little mad about it
my regular readers know i get the chance to meet so many of my favorite people
and in doing that i have come to recognize about other people who also do it regularly
so it blew my mind that almost none of them were there
it was all new people who were crazy passionate about this franchise and these characters
so if i am going to miss out i would rather miss out to people who are passionate about this exclusively
so seeing people out about meeting actors who play their favorite characters was enough to keep me happy
i feel very right now watching other peoples happiness making me happy and stuff

we have known each other for years now
during this time both of us grew immensely
often into opposite directions
and in some ways into the same direction
we often have to agree to disagree on certain subjects
and for the first time in my life i mind
i feel the need to convert her not that that would work i need to convince of how right i am
the simple fact is that it does not matter at all
because when it comes down to it
we do agree about the most important things in life
we just approach them differently
we love and respect each other for who we are and we talk when we feel that something is wrong

once keaton steps up onto the movie screen not fully integrated into the film thats playing
immune to the cut so he remains the one constant as the scene changes which leads to some hilarious visual gags
for a few minutes the movie on the screen following dream logic ceases to be a coherent drama and starts randomly cutting from one strange locale to another always with keaton propelled across the cut into one outrageous situation after another
he balances on the edge of a cliff runs from hungry lions almost gets run over by a train and the traffic on a crowded street and gets soaked by waves while perched on a rock in the middle of a choppy sea
its both a devilishly clever comic showcase and a lovingly ode to the power of this cinematic tool which can bridge such tremendous gaps in location having keaton jump into the air to dive into the water but instead land in a his feet kicking in the air

going to poetry readings creating visual art projects together doing communal art projects does help create a sense of community connection and empathy
when we realize that we are all connected then we do become creative and in new ways
we know that by going to art workshops joining art groups and spending an afternoon playing with a friend in our studio helps us feel freshly creative in new and different ways
deep empathy is a knowledge that we are not that different
there is something about working together to create something new that joins us at a heart level

recently i have had some unusual things popping up in my garden
sometime around thanksgiving i found a rake had been placed in my garden
at first i thought my neighbors left it out and a passerby put it in my yard thinking it was mine but it did not belong to my neighbors
then about a week later i found two more rakes in the same place
i always wait until the last leaf falls to do any raking so maybe someone was trying to drop a hint
on monday of this week i found another rake not far from where the others were left
i now have four new rakes on top of the two i already own
so i am either being my yard is some sort of lost and found area or someone is up to no good
i just wish they would quit with the rakes and leave me a pair of bypass or a telescoping pole pruner
these i could use

the wolf has held an honored place in many mythologies folklore and religions throughout human history and across many cultures
wolves were and are creatures to be respected feared and admired
for these animals the extended family unit or pack is the center of their lives
wolves show great nurturing and gentle care for one another while also displaying vicious ferocity and cunning on their hunts in competition with one another and in the defense of territory and their pack
they are animals of great intelligence and physical prowess

in an article entitled legal beagles in cross hairs reports that the sec and many others in law enforcement have ongoing investigations into the role of attorneys not of their clients

with the necessary supplies and tools now in hand i returned home and decided to try to tackle the shelf
i wish that i could say that i got it right on the first try or that i was even smart enough to practice on a piece of scrap wood before trying to drill the recessed holes in the actual shelf
not so much
i used a couple adjustable clamps to secure the shelf to my work bench loaded the bit into my drill and plowed forward like i was a pro who knew exactly what he was doing
i mean how hard can it be to drill the recessed holes used a drill a lot before
well it turns out that i should have practiced because i use the proper speed for the drill bit and it got stuck and made an uneven cut on the first hole
somehow i managed to correct this mistake and moved on to the second depression which is where i encountered the fatal problem
apparently i clamp the shelf appropriately for the torque the drill put on the piece of wood especially since the bit caught the edge of a knot in the wood because the shelf twisted as i was applying pressure to drill through the knot causing the drill bit to skip and really mess up the hole
the damage was far too great to fix this time and i realized i had just ruined my shelf
what an idiot
after the drilling debacle i now had to cut sand and burn another shelf
i wasted a whole lot of time and energy that i could have saved by simply taking the time to practice first

the great red dragon is a pretty sweet sounding record with that aforementioned guitar sound the clarity of the drums and vocals and surprisingly a nice thick bass tone which anchors it all into a darker foreboding space
many bands spend whole careers such a balance yet have done it in just two records
the only caveat here is that while i appreciate the bands infernal level of energy and the fact that they keep the tunes tense brief and incendiary nothing ever feels quite that unique or memorable
this is a effort mind you and few songs feel precisely the same plus it has the benefit of arriving and departing in under minutes and some well written blasphemous lyrics but i call it infectious

how can he make such a statement first of all he is reminded of the source of true joy and happiness

in fact if you paraphrase piece and substitute for session beers it reads almost exactly like it was written by a smug mainstream brewer in get lots of press but they actually sell american and heavy so most americans wont like them they cost more than going to pay the whole ideas too complicated because we really just want to drink a its too much work for a bar to carry or a bartender to answer questions about so it wont work
this is not to say that committees were perfect or are inevitably the best solution
they can and often were criticised for being slow to make decisions leaving it unclear who was responsible for decisions and for sustaining such as education authorities which at times seemed to have little involvement with other parts of the council
the criticisms can be answered
the committee system can be fast and keep confidences when it matters
with a cabinet or indeed an elected mayor leadership is still distributed with chief executives or chief officers often the real leaders
can be broken down if there is the political will to do so
but none of this is easy and there were plenty of disillusioned and frustrated councillors and officers in the past
all we can say with confidence is that no system is perfect and that each council needs to work out what is best for its own purposes

after the many months since the finale i was extremely interested to see and hear viewers thoughts and ideas about what they experienced over the six seasons of lost
i was also curious to see if their ideas and theories changed over time since the finale
i utilized as a small forum to present questions to fans regarding general topics of the lost story
i loved the excitement with all the lost talk but honestly was troubled by the amount of anger i witnessed when someone share similar views
nonetheless everyone threw something into the lost stew
my friends like the pictures i share on
their happiness gives me tremendous joy
often i know the reasons behind their impressions
i even try to understand
it is enough that they allow me the freedom to capture these memories and that they like my albums

there are a few additional steps involved in making this recipe compared to traditional brownies
the brownie batter itself is pretty standard but instead of baking it all at once half is added to the pan and baked then once it cools briefly the caramel is poured on top and then covered with the remaining half of the brownie batter
heres the thing the recipe actually call for melting down caramel candies with heavy cream for the caramel layer
i decided to try subbing my leftover salted caramel sauce instead and while the brownies were tasty they were sort of a mess
it was nearly impossible to spread the brownie batter over the sauce so instead those two layers were essentially swirled together
it took much longer for the brownies to bake and the caramel bubbled out the sides quite a bit and left me trying to chisel the brownies out of the pan

recently i had a dream which drove me to awaken with sweats and untoward tingling sensations i very seldom get from dreams
the images laid upon my mind were confusing but reminded me of a childhood tale i chose to block out of my mind later in life
the story in question was that of by charles
the narrative itself is said to be loosely inspired by de one of the worlds most infamous serial killers
why i cannot rightly tell you
de was a serial killer who picked on small children if the crimes attributed to him were in fact heinous acts of his doing in an effort to gain a fortune from a demon
the of the tale on the other hand has motives that seem uncertain
unless of course you think like a as i will prove in a moment

this is a difficult post for me to write because i know so many people have worse problems going on than i do

i have to confess that in part interviewing so many brilliant authors has just been a whole lot easier than on about what been up to mostly because what been up to equates to stress
i cant say given my post about being glass half full that particularly proud of that but i guess sometimes life just gets in the way and gets overwhelming
a few years back scientific american magazine published a study suggesting the earths poles are very susceptible to this global warming
it calculated that if the ice of greenland antarctic east and antarctic west all melted it would raise the ocean levels by feet

spirit selection is impressive and the prices at around a drink are entirely reasonable for a hotel of this caliber

after switching to beta and spending many hours of struggling with this specific technology issue before getting it working i thought it would be nice to give back to others
almost immediately my web hit counter went up by about most of them directly going to this post either from a search engine mainly link or another referral
considering the combination of beta and users is probably not that large i found it interesting that over the next weeks i had at least two thousand more hits on this single post

i just spent words expounding on how awful the story is if you figured it out already than holy

in the end is trying to set up a third way between the traditional church and the emergent church
his third way envelopes three elements for defining the body that christ left for his work on earth
they are the bible traditions and culture
of course both the traditional and emergent church believe they are using the bible in their development but they see the bible in very different ways
the traditional camp interprets the bible based on traditions
the emergent side works from a context of understanding the bible according to the culture

mike from reported that although these items were not included in latest negotiations with union which already concluded they can be brought up ad hoc during the contract period and agreed
at the chapter meeting last week shared the history of previous attempts to establish a citizen review commission brought by a broad coalition of groups
it initially had the support of the fop fraternal order of police union since the original concept was to allow officers to bring complaints against department management
but after a while they backed off and the idea stalled then went nowhere
wants folks to discuss topic again with their organizations to determine if there is enough support and willingness to do the hard work it would take to revive this campaign
today there is no public in complaints lodged against county police officers
says most if not all complaints are determined by internal affairs to be without merit or result in officer was which is meaningless nothing but a slap on the wrist
i personally agree that a civilian complaint review board is warranted especially considering the broadening of police forces expanding grants and ties with fbi ice and the increasing police violence and deaths and injuries from tear gas rubber bullets that were seeing all over the country
ill raise this topic at the next monthly meeting on may nd

we were vegetarian city kids
i spent years a vegetarian
the only thing i knew about animal slaughter for many years i learned from brochures
i always wanted a farm but i thought id have a vegetarian farm
i was young and naive
then we decided to stop being vegetarian but eat only meat humanely raised
shortly after that our good friends taught us how to butcher ducks and then a pig
we learned so much from them talking about brett who wrote for the winter newsletter
so really this is still all so new to us
it come naturally yet at all and we have no idea how to properly cut meat into fancy things like steaks
and i feel like reading another language when i read meat cooking recipes never having cooked it in my adult life
but were making great strides and learning more more all the time
as the teacher at the center i saw the kids who chose to come downstairs to my rooms lit by the strange blue light of my glowing computer screens to let me poke and at their brains filling in the gaps left by too many vacations from school too many schools in general one kid had been in seventeen schools between the ages of five and fourteen and too many years when their brains were simply in which left precious little time for learning

the answers are many
for one its not quite feasible in the
go as far in the
as it does in malawi
another reason may sound unfair but hey your always tell you that life fair developing countries simply need these services more
sure there are people in the united states who would greatly benefit from similar services but at least the united states has some form of infrastructure and other safety net services that help people out
women in malawi and other developing countries literally have no other option and would probably be unable to feed their family if they have these financial services through micro loans

it had producers willing to cut corners

one of the problems we face as lay disciples of jesus is that the modern church is not structured to properly assist lay people who are not part of the religious establishment to follow the personal path of the lord is calling them to follow
the modern church establishment does not expect lay people to enter into such individual
the establishment expects that any one who has such a call to either enter a seminary to become a priest deacon or minister or to join some religious order
it is difficult to overcome the prejudices of the past that have placed lay christians as passive servants of the clergy having no understanding of things spiritual

they are not secure in their committed relationships and obviously feel a lacking somewhere within
they believe of that lack that at any given time their partner will leave or lose interest
as a result they use others outside of the relationship as a way to fill or correct what they feel they are lacking and hope that this will seal some sort of idea in their partners mind that they are super desirable with a boatload of options

in the original i added the title war and peace to the novel the guy was reading in order to show that he may be in the gutter but trying to better himself through literature
last monday the th i had an academic planning meeting with my field liaison the director of the program and the director of
essentially my liaison is concerned about me not being able to pass my due to problems that have been occurring over the course of the year
i was initially at the middle school but after about a month and a half i was transferred to the high school due to a lot of issues with my field instructor supervisor
since going to the high school i feel like its been one issue after another
i got really low ratings on my evaluation at the end of first semester and in my opinion they were largely in part to my supervisor not providing supervision like we were supposed to have each week
plus my supervisor continues to believe that i am a clinical level student but a foundation level student
the difference between the two is that the foundation year is the first year of the year program
everyone takes identical classes and its kind of like taking general education classes
except they are specific social work classes
the second year of the program is where you decide between the clinical track or the administration track and your classes and is based on which track you take
so the clinical track is the track that i plan to take next year
my supervisor expects me to be at the level of a clinical student despite that still in my foundation year
this has caused a lot of problems in terms of expectations and experience because just not at the place my supervisor thinks i need to be
needless to say this meeting was a session to come up with ways to make sure i pass
the outcome ended up being in my opinion telling me to just do what i have to do in order to pass
established that i have no desire to be a school social worker so i think thats the biggest problem that my supervisor has with me
that i have a passion to be a school social worker
my passion is working with the military population and people with and mental health disorders
i even loved my job working in foster care
but i despise being in the school setting
i disagree with the policies i feel its a helpful environment and i just plain like it
maybe its the district maybe its me
who knows its just not my cup of tea

for several months now there has been considerable speculation in the community that as well as taking on the george town cruise facilities a cruise pier at cayman turtle farm in west bay and the reconstruction of the at would also be involved in the airport project

the agencies both have automated underwriting systems and these systems are initially run by the processor to see what the minimum documentation is and then anything questionable must be documented also
the underwriter then uses their expertise to further analyze the file the documentation and the overall risk factor that may exist
the automated underwriting systems spit out minimum documentation requirements from what has been entered into the system
it is a machine so it cannot see with the human eye and only uses information it has been given by the human therefore there is room for error
when something changes after it is documented income assets liabilities after being verified the automated underwriting system must be changed along with the new information and new underwriting requirements review yet again
as with any process sometimes this has not been done properly therefore underwriting decisions can be made that are not actually the true story as it has been verified
these systems are governed by humans and as we all know humans make mistakes and even though there are explicit guidelines that should be followed there are still errors made that can change the approved status to a declined status
mortgage underwriters and processors have decided that it is best to fully document a file and then there are less risk and more prudent analysis done

i first want to take a look at investors intelligence
over time this has proven to be one of the better gauges of sentiment that i have seen
here is a look over the past years
the keys to look for when looking for a major top are bulls at less than and ratios over
for at least a few weeks
while one rely on this indicator alone it has been quite useful
i want to start with mid and work forward
the market made an initial peak in july before a nasty correction into august
the ratio was over
for close to months straight and bearish readings were below
in october the ratio had a big two week spike and bulls moved below once again
that ended up being the top of the bull run from march october
after the peak sentiment fell off a cliff and never really recovered until late
the ratio spent about months up near
and bearish readings were clearly under
the market then saw a correction in january of or so
now look to april ahead of the flash crash
readings were up near
and bearish sentiment was under
now look at the peak in april
the ratio was over
for the better part of months before that high and actually spiked up to
right before the peak
at that time bearish sentiment was once again under
now look at where we are today
last week was the first time since april that the ratio came close to
and bearish sentiment is still
these are not the kind of numbers one would expect near a major market peak with regard to sentiment
its the present that alone matters

the pain in her abdomen feels like fire and knives and she can almost imagine the organs punching deep fangs inside of her body draining her of to feed their growth
she continues to cry and wriggle about actually pulling one arm free and twisting into the grasp of the other captor
she suddenly grasps the person with both hands and smoke curls up from under her hands as milky fluid begins from bulging porous flesh in her palms and finger tips
the liquid eats at the pristine white of the persons uniform causing it to howl in pain as the milk makes contact with the bare skin beneath
the other uniformed being unaware of the cause wraps its arms around her and attempts to pull her off
one of the organs painfully detaches from her body like some sort of creature and attaches itself to the other guards arm and another loud shriek fills the room as it pulls away from her

i think most of the people who hold this view probably started with good intentions
at face value it sounds much friendlier and supposedly this way no ones feelings get hurt and the pressure is off
but who decided that for something to be true it had to be pleasant and accommodating to everyone regardless of any good intentions there is a giant gaping hole in the logic behind making an absolute claim stating that there are no absolute claims

once you figure out how to attach the foot to your machine its actually relatively simple
the motion of the needle drives a sharp bit of metal back and forth causing fabric threaded through a particular part of the foot to bunch up
how much it bunches per stitch is controlled by a little another little lever adjusts whether the gathering takes place on every stitch or only once per so many stitches
this means you can technically use the foot for making as well and control your gathering ratio quite precisely
fabric tension and stitch length also play a role

shes exactly where i was years ago when i started asking questions about my catholic

only a collective and conscious movement of students around can effectively strengthen it
a movement that collectively ensures that woman students feel confident enough to report cases of harassment and are not forced to retreat owing to mounting social pressures

where women are not forced to constantly adjust their according to the male choices or
bodies and minds are not forced and tortured to adhere to beauty chastity housewife roles and rules the prevalent feudal and morality

as a harvard graduate student i came to know numerous radical activists
i have posed this questions to many of them and in most cases only heard that a new way has to be found or that it is impossible to understand the socialist future when living under capitalist conditions
other activists however told me that they are not against the state as such only against the
that distinction is however irrelevant
because what they criticize in the is first and foremost its power to command and control
unfortunately power is just the aspect of the state that they need in order to implement their projects
the dream of social equality requires more power more coercion and more ideological indoctrination to enforce it
so even if the will be abolished and another unidentified state will rise from its ashes it will still have to exercise power lots and lots of power in order to implement social projects
so we are back at point zero and the paradox remains acute as ever

we have been fortunate that this damaged presidency has occurred during a time of relative peace and prosperity
in times of war or national emergency it is often necessary for the president to call upon the nation to make great economic and personal sacrifices
in these occasions our president had best be truth teller whose life of principled leadership and integrity we can count upon
some commentators have suggested that with the president having less than two years left in his term of office the easiest approach is to let the clock expire while hoping that he is sufficiently careful if not contrite to avoid reckless and indefensible conduct
but as senators we know that the dangers of the world constantly threaten us
rarely do two years pass without the need for strong presidential leadership and the exercise of substantial moral authority from the white house

over the year feelings became close to an obsession and each meeting and word from de took on almost a religious significance
de herself was a catholic was a scientific
he saw de as his moral superior and began to infuse his theories of the human condition with a more religious
he concluded that cults and celebrations are indispensable for mankind although he still leaned away from catholicism and the traditional church
these are the radical activist

first he takes out a couple of employees in a bar with some jabs to the sternum
this prompts darren to put reese on retainer for cents a bargain if ever i saw one
reese then finds a couple more thugs named curtis and trim and steals their escalade
for the record curtis and trim are the next great comedy
trim wants curtis to call the insurance company but curtis reminds him that the of them stole the car in the first place
trim then suggests that since curtis bought new rims for it they might replace those
he closed the scroll handed it back to the attendant and sat down
the eyes of everyone in the place were fastened on him

this is the time of year when my reign supreme
deprived of outdoor gardening i focus my considerable nurturing energies on the plants that live inside with me
i them with tepid water once a day i whisk away the least dry leaf before it can fall to the floor and i have to hold myself back from over watering and over fertilizing
before i entered their house i searched through my planner looking for the number and find it but i thought that i would just let my instincts guide me
well my instincts were wrong and next thing i knew the alarm was going off and the police were there
anyway enough and onto the crafting
this week has seen the birthday of a friend who has become especially dear to me
elaine is one of my craft stamping quartet buddies as many of my visitors already know and along with jo and judith she has become one of the main constants in my life so making a card incorporating things she likes was such a pleasure to do
elaine loves nature and has a huge wild garden with lots of mature trees and i know she loves it in whatever coat it happens to be wearing
as its september i decided to go with an autumnal look both with the i used and also with the leaf embellishments
elaine knows one of my things to do is blending inks over masks and as chocolate baroque have just started stocking some exceptionally pretty prima ones which i resist buying i thought thats where i would start my design
i followed this with some light using a stamp from an set called autumn fall which i must have had for at least years and never inked up
shame on me because the stamps are really dainty with lovely leafy
however expect honesty fairness or anything approaching truth from channel four or any western media
back to the lecture at hand
the challenge is more than one fold so i have made an easel card used this lovely stamped image from hooked on craft called honey bears with mounted on round die cuts backing paper is capsule flowers and foliage from
the sentiment is from cindy ribbon lace and button from stash
the change is unnecessary
challenging this change also draws attention to the fact that is very much in favor of history for it has just as much to do with our future

london porter always strikes me as a easy drinking porter with not too much roasted malt and a lighter body
there are some sweeter almost notes that paired nicely with the more intense and buttery taste of the cheese like a complementary relationship with one side making up in the places the other lacks
not that either lack anything as far as taste goes but you get my drift good accompaniment
the carbonation battled the delicious saltiness and lifted the and proteins that coated the tongue
a solid pairing even for going a little out on a limb
but maybe if i keep doing it then i might start having to let go less and less and then before long i will have let go without even it

the poems found within the covers of her latest poetry collection shadow crossing are often enigmatic although some general comments can be proffered
the first eleven poems are grouped under the section title the path of no return
here the path can perhaps be interpreted as the arc of an individual life as the poems tend to deal with significant formative experiences the cruelty absurdity and mystery of life and possible responses to such
the first poem in apogee lays out the need to understand the forces that shape us in its opening lines

she bent to pick up the little ceramic lamp and filled it with oil from the captains flask
when the lamp to life she found she was in a room shaped much like the one above except this one was carved and polished rock salt
shining like crystal the chamber was a faceted dome with the stone ladder descending like a column down the center
four carved spaced equally led from the room
there was a tinkling sound coming from each and gasped to see small streams of water running down the center of each hallway to splash through grates at the threshold of each as they entered the chamber where she stood
she had lost her sense of direction and so turned to the nearest

subject matter is an important element in novel writing
what who and when are issues that can determine the impact a novelist makes on the publishing community
for a publisher marketing issues are paramount
since the public is notoriously fickle in its interests the publishing often has to anticipate what will most engage the public mind in the twelve to eighteen months it will take for a mainstream publisher to produce and market a book
for it is a lot easier to anticipate
for fiction publishers need to consult a psychic

it was a gorgeous new york an inch and a half thick and cooked to perfection and for some reason the smell of it made me want to hurl
i only ever avoid food when i am stressed and for me to avoid steak there is something seriously up
it was horrible
nothing in the world could make me take a bite of the meat
i had to put it in the other room

the male crisis is a difficult subject to bring up around some people since it exists primarily as a physiological condition
yes us guys have to deal with such things like an unwanted horizontal expansion at the waistline or an accelerated retreat of the we at least can exercise to fight the growing bulge or buy medicinal remedies to battle an war to keep something fuzzy on our heads
no this is something that affects guys on a far deeper level see i will be honest here and write something that should be adult males never really grow up

doctors what do they know
i take a moment and reflect
i know that everyone has their own trials in life if not currently they have had or will have
but how easy it is to look at complete strangers and imagine how perfect their lives must be in comparison to my own
i know from my own experience that a smile can do a pretty good job of concealing the mountain of hurt inside me
certainly the same holds true for the rest of the world
any showdown of resentment or jealousy that up toward the happy perfect people is a waste of time and energy
of what benefit is it to compare myself to others god created us all uniquely and no two life experiences could possibly be the same
to utilize the worn out saying it is comparing apples to oranges it would be very very easy to let the bitterness seep through my veins like a deadly poison
at times it is tempting to let go and collapse into a heap of defeat and letting the waves take me under
its during these times of weakness that my spiritual survival instinct kicks in
i know to call out to jesus
without fail he rescues me and guides me back into the shallow waters

more interesting to me was the fact that classes went to the small festival cinema in they walked down to the train station and caught a train into the big main station in essen where they changed trains presumably this meant getting all the kids off one train and onto the platform going down a set of steps through a subway to another set of steps and up onto another platform to catch the train out to kids aged between and adults

i ended up making a pretty gourmet lunch today
it was mostly rearranging some leftovers but it came together very nicely
the other day at the store i saw artichokes that looked really awesome
when i was a kid used to make artichokes for us and she taught us how to peel off the leaves one by one dip them into a butter sauce and then pull them between your teeth for the one small bite that was at the base of each leaf
its a lot of work but it is worth it because it is so good
to make the artichoke just put some water in a pan and steam the artichoke for minutes or until the leaves pull off very easily
the butter sauce i did today was super simple melted clarified butter with vinegar and salt
lemon juice is extraordinary with artichokes but i have any lemons

they feature colorado beers on tap and chris does a good job of scooping up rarer of brews like avery addict and russian river sanctification
be sure to ask about barrel aged beers that on the menu as they have a habit of sending old whiskey barrels to local breweries and getting of whatever the brewery makes with them in return

the level of intrigue and mystique surrounding the third province is interminable

the character from the will be the main protagonist from the story and the weapon designed will more than likely be a standard weapon of today such as a ak rifle or ma carbine rifle
it will be adjusted however to fit the story and its setting with weapon modifications etc
this will also apply to clothing and on the character i will need to consider that things may have changed for the character in the future setting than it would be in modern times

having said all of this my conclusion is that precedent was set with the very institution of the wild card rule and that the rule that is currently in effect has absolutely nothing to do with setting ones qualification for worlds
therefore my conclusion is that should simply disband the rule altogether as it really serves no useful purpose and merritt or any other athlete should be the wild card pass that they earned when they finished first in the previous world championships

it is also fairly idiotic in that he is so correct the author discusses what foods use the least amount of natural resources to produce require little of our dwindling water supply and cause a minimal amount of pollution
does any really care about such things when putting together the evening meal does it matter to anyone that farmers are probably more concerned about such things than you they are not in the business of running up the water bill if mother nature will provide some rain
they are not in the business of polluting the food crops on which they depend

a very common thread however is that professors are becoming disillusioned by the lack of maturity of undergraduate students
this semester seems to be the worst by my observation for professors spelling out the rules that should be common sense
cell phones must be completely off and cannot be out during class
assignments must be turned in on time
excuses that will be accepted for missed exams and assignments are very narrow
extra credit is no longer being offered because of past abuses by previous classes

there is nothing magical going on as the author has opted to instead focus on the creatures and technology which appears aplenty towards the end
overall flowed well but the middle was a little slow with the romance aspect taking a bit too much time to cement itself
there is plenty of action and witty dialogues along the way to things keep moving a pace
the dialogue and own internal thoughts were the best aspect
i thought the properness of it all would grain on me after a time but the author so much humor that she averts that chasm to the point where i looked forward to having things made more formal again to appreciate the jokes and situations

some potential weaknesses of analysis are the following
in approach the turbulent would have taken place in interior for over two billion years
in this time interior properties would be likely to change due to the heat transferred to the surface and the amount of sulfur and silicate compounds deposited on the surface
it seems doubtful that the interior properties could support this type of for such a long time
secondly the time scale of the build up of the mantle hot spots or magma chambers from model is only years yet the time frame of the orbital oscillations is on the order of million years
these two phenomena should be related in some realistic way if tidal dissipation is the primary heat source in io
also assumed a high temperature value at the beginning of the resonance period in history
this high temperature would stem from radioactive decay in early history and a proposed period of greater tidal dissipation in the past as orbit was evolving into resonance
considering other studies of heat from radioactive decay from an evolutionary viewpoint this temperature may be unrealistic
most other studies of interior use temperatures of approximately or

as we face the challenges before us it is imperative that we trust each other knowing that no matter how different our opinions or our styles or our decisions are that we are united in our love and commitment to jesus christ
this will not be easy
there have been many reasons that trust has been broken in this presbytery

helen is a maid working at the same hotel as albert
she falls madly in love with joe aaron johnson a poor young man who managed to fix the hotels heating
joe dreams of leaving for america and wants to take helen with him

and for our what people that actually read this and check it regularly were sorry
its been quite the adjustment getting used to my new schedule which in turn has made eric and allis schedule quite different too
were also busy with trying to prepare for christmas mainly the drive back to ohio
i know we mentioned before that this is the first time well be driving back home for christmas and were definitely excited
my has promised me the best gift ever
her waking up with each morning and letting me sleep in
shes even going to let us use her brand new bedroom furniture in her room upstairs and sleep in the guest room while sleeps in my old room so we really wont hear her and can just get some rest
i think thats better than any christmas present i could ask for i am really looking forward to it
on the flip side we have really on decorating around here
i guess its because we know were leaving a week from tomorrow and well be in ohio for a week so there was really no point in getting our house all decked out here when we wont be here to enjoy it
so we have a tree with lights but no ornaments
its the thought that counts right and i were hanging out with our friends this afternoon and their even mentioned to me what not putting up all the lights this year we are usually the only house in the neighborhood to put up a bunch of lights
not this year
i feel like a bad buddy elf i really do love christmas
next year were going all out again ill make sure of it
i was fortunate to have visited two very beautiful cities here and with my wife and the trip meant we ended on a high
it is incredible that you can experience cold and warm climates just hours apart and this country has so many beautiful cultures and places to see
more than the wonderful what got my attention was how different the people there were from the people living in or near colombo
everyone seems ready to offer you some sort of help or curious to know what you are expecting of them
they are laid back and hardworking at the same time
time seemed to slow for us when we were there
even the supposedly train ride was an experience of a lifetime
i would go there over and over if i do get the chance
this is the kind of love hate relationship i am talking about
i will admit that i have let up this year on the usual cavalcade of junk that makes my family room look like sleigh threw up
its a smaller pile this year
as the boys get older the gifts seem to get smaller and more expensive and we have decidedly the belts as well
we have a pool to pay off right merry christmas boys
granted the injunction substantially in the terms sought except that he refused to prohibit disclosure of the bare facts that i and were in a relationship and that ii is the father of twins
for the sake of clarity he stated that he was not ordering that any disclosure be made nor was he anyone to make that disclosure he was just declining to prohibit it by an injunction
regarding the twins he added that without having heard any evidence of submissions about the rights and interests of first family or of the twins he could not be satisfied that the claimants were likely to succeed in establishing that publication of the information in question to first family should not be allowed
this being so an injunction was neither necessary nor proportionate
well writing to me is passion the passion to mark my words with something i feel deeply attached with
it is the passion that helps me in incorporating my thoughts in some identifiable shape which are otherwise always messed up
writing is the passion which helps me deal with the situations in daily life
writing the passion to achieve the highest limit i can think of achieving to come out as a better person a better interpreter
writing is the passion for me to strive struggle to reach that limit and then set an even higher limit to achieve

under our form of government the use of property and the making of contracts are normally matters of private and not of public concern
the general rule is that both shall be free of governmental interference
but neither property rights nor contract rights are absolute for government cannot exist if the citizen may at will use his property to the detriment of his fellows or exercise his freedom of contract to work them harm
equally fundamental with the private right is that of the public to regulate it in the common interest

watch how they are looking in awe of everything around them
take them outside
place them under a tree and watch as they are completely captivated
when is the last time you really looked at a tree or on that note anything if you look with your full being the experience is breathtaking
our problem is that we mentally label everything
and once we label things we stop looking deeply
we lose depth in our perception of things
we look at the tree and label it tree and look again
we are missing all the beauty magic abundance and life around us

while we haunted by ghosts the night we stayed at the shaffer one of the women that worked at the hotel was being stalked by an who threatened to shoot everyone inside
he drove by a couple times and the police were called
at one point while eating in the restaurant we were asked to step away from the front window
for a few minutes we drank our tea by the cash register waiting to see which way things would go
but in the end there was no gunfire at the shaffer that night surely how pop would prefer it
the other bottle was something of a mystery

there is a direct line from the aspirations of dadaism to waste land
but unlike so many developments informed by it waste land does not take that first fateful individualistic step that mostly tends to existential absurdity and despairing irony
in the film recycling is a collective act in more than one sense of the word collective
the associated labour process that reclaims materials previously designated as useless entails the of these materials as useful
what is more this transformation is from stuff not having as privately owned property to stuff having as collectively owned property
at the level of then the art work is socialist property
when i followed weight watchers i learned that fiber was great
the more fiber you eat in something the fewer points it had which meant that you got to eat more
i liked that
i care about much beyond that
that is silly of me especially considering the fact that i just mentioned how much sadness i have about all of this
i think one thing that i am really sad about is that stayed in such a situation for so long
put myself and through

wisdom is not in analysis
you suffer and by analysis you try to find the cause that is you are analyzing a dead event the cause that is already in the past
what you must do is find the cause of suffering in the very moment of suffering
by analyzing suffering you do not find the cause you analyze only the cause of a particular act
then you say i have understood the cause of that suffering
but in reality you have only learned to avoid the suffering you have not freed your mind from it
this process of accumulation of learning through the analysis of a particular act does not give wisdom
wisdom arises only when the i consciousness which is the creator the cause of suffering is dissolved

so far least in puppy training has been all
we give treats for sit and treats for down and treats for wait and treats for this and treats for that and we play the drop it game in which we distract the pups from chewing on our socks and shoes and other contraband by scattering treats across the ground and merrily singing drop it and they abandon the sock and scramble after the treats and eventually they will abandon the sock on the command no treats necessary
my reluctance to perform in an ensemble also stemmed from watching the previous school concert when i was hosting it

now obviously having kids everywhere is going to be a constant reminder of why trying to fight the disease but the kids represent more than that
the lack of parents has left the kids to form a microcosm within the town and ignoring the grownups and engaging in their very own politics and battles
some third world country who has fallen out of favor with the groups
the law explained for example in the de decision is quite clear
student associations do not have the same status as trade unions
they are not entitled to impose their strike votes on their members as trade unions are
students contract for education services and pay however little
they are entitled to have the classes they contract and pay for
they suffer great prejudice if they lose their semester

brown talks a big game on morals and personal character yet he is frequently shown up on these very characteristics
he his staff and his government have been caught out countless times for lying and it is an characteristic of this labour government that they will only speak to their version of events and their version of the truth
this is of course never an accurate reflection of real life of the real situation of the real statistics or experiences of people
in the conversation with mrs duffy today he was untruthful to her
when she asked what he was going to do about the debt he replied he would cut in in half in four years
the labour policy as i have written about before is in fact not to cut debt in four years but to cut the deficit in four years
a liar to the very end

field event competitors too with long jump high jump shot put and discus relays and others where the marks of four competitors are totaled together to determine a team winner
it all leads to tremendous excitement

merle in the growth of american thought argued that social admirably suited the needs of the great captains of industry who were crushing the little fellows when these vainly tried to compete with them

and of course robert has said that social offered a perfect moral justification for americas gilded age when robber barons controlled much of american industry the gap between the rich and poor turned into a chasm urban slums and politicians were bought off by the wealthy
the modern conservative movement has embraced social with no less fervor than it has condemned

another way depicts the philosophers as leading up to is by treating falsehood as a kind of world in its own right and the apprehension of falsehood as a separate matter from discerning truth
then the pagan philosophers can be conceded to have done the easier task recognizing what is false without being able to find truth
this depends upon a reversal of classical predicates now the false is evident and the true is hidden
truth compels men with its essential force only when god releases it from concealment

compared to these concerns the questions at issue in the case canada
might be rather pedestrian
at least it does not appear from the judgment that the federal government or the are opposed as a matter of principle or policy to inquiry into the shady dealings in its construction industry and that links with the provincial government
might this change if the inquiry uncovers links between that industry and the federal government as a report by the globe mail suggests it well may but given the sheer volume of the information it is asked for the is probably concerned about the costs of complying with the request as it is with preserving the secrecy of its inquiry methods and sources
the court however suggests that these concerns are overstated capable of being addressed by the cooperation with the commission of inquiry and with provincial police
as for the constitutional position the court holds that a commission of inquiry set up pursuant to provincial law can validly subpoena the and request information in its possession so long as it does not inquire about the administration
the as the supreme court has held is not part of the civil service and does not enjoy the same immunities from provincial inquiries as the federal crown or its servants

kept the cards quite simple
hope you like

one of my favorite areas to teach is writing
i think that a students writing truly shows the growth over a year
i know that in the past i have always enjoyed going back to my childhood and seeing just what i was like as a child
since i began my first year of teaching i have always wanted to create this same experience for my students
every year i keep all of the writings that we complete in a big container
then at the end of the year we pull that container out and we sort through the students writing
this has definitely become one of our favorite days of the year
i love hearing the students reflect on all of their learning through the year and it always makes them so proud of their accomplishments
i love the fact that i can send my students into their next school year as proud and writers

your average territory cattle is deeply concerned about how his or her livestock is treated
all farmers with cattle care about their livestock and take pains to make sure that the animals are as happy as possible
but how to get this message across into the metro media the place that conditions government responses to issues that arise from time to time in the public sphere this is the challenge
its not easy but its not impossible either
i wrote this post in the hope that it can help farmers to understand the dynamics of the metro media from the point of view of a journalist
a lot of metro news outfits do not take stories now due to the difficult economic times newspapers are facing
but that mean that you cant get your message across
for many newspapers staff journalists are in constant contact with public relations operatives who send them story ideas in the same way that a will pitch a story to editors and journalists working for a news vehicle

my mother gave me clear and detailed directions about riding the public bus for the first time out of my neighborhood into an part of the city
her protective clarity and warnings about what i might encounter scared me though i was a very tall large and confident girl who had not feared people or places before
i struggled to digest why anyone would want to harm me but against the backdrop of the television news shows i soon realized that negroes are not safe when alone
as a working woman and single mother my mother could not afford to accompany me to the large junior high school where school testing was provided
i arrived at the school of four wing locations after walking alone from the bus stop which let me off about a from the school
i walked alone quickly speaking to no one and soon arrived on campus confused about which entrance to enter
after two failed attempts i approached a caucasian woman just arriving on the parking lot and asked about where to find the school testing entrance
she turned out to be the school psychologist who would conduct the testing and i walked with her into the school
she was nice talking comfortably with me she felt safe to me
i liked her and soon was not afraid anymore
taking the time to explain the testing and with me i started the varied aspects of testing
there was a comfort in knowing that test items were not difficult for me and i completed all sections before the test period ended
i would return in two weeks for results and a discussion of my placement recommendations
i left assured that i a black girl had done my best

no worries on that front my buds were there plus a couple of their husbands
and a surprise friend who is my longest running friend since i moved here to ohio
we get to spend a lot of time together because our lives move in such wildly separate directions so it was awesome that she was able to make it

ironic how we had to know each other here

i and recorded all the information i could find
let me also add i read a number of books on including those by mark levine and dan among others

my approach with the forums if possible was to observe as a guest for a period of time and then register at a later date

they are either too little frequented or full of

top developer treasury holdings is in the wars with
in january had receivers appointed to a slew of treasury properties and companies treasury got upset and applied to the high court in dublin for a judicial review of dealings with its loans the courts last month granted treasury its wish for a judicial review which is set to take place in the coming months
treasury is according to and it seem to be disputed by any party insolvent it has loans of

she is the most independent person i have ever known she could do anything and she taught me about the importance of counting on yourself and learning how to solve problems and situations alone

also excited to change my diet up as well
shauna and i have decided to make our household a light environment
given that i have a relationship with bread the change is a necessary one

i successfully adopted a low low calorie low sodium high healthy protein diet in september when i needed to drop pounds in weeks to fit into a bridesmaid dress for my friends wedding
it was like a week cleanse that i kept up for a couple months afterwards
i discovered a salad recipe that i love and have yet to get sick of
i really need a breakfast
but boo start until tuesday august th
so i guess i should really wait a week
i cant ever remember school starting this early
but there are no complaints from this mama
