#' @description
#' The Model class represents n-gram models. An instance of the class is a
#' single n-gram model. The attributes of this class are used to store n-gram
#' model information. The class provides methods for loading and saving the
#' model.
#'
#' @details
#' The attributes of this class are used to store n-gram model information such
#' as model name, model description, model file name, n-gram size, transition
#' probabilities data, default probability for words, data cleaning and
#' tokenization options, word list, model path, data directory path and
#' performance stats. The model is saved to a single file as a R object.
#'
#' A model file contains all the information required by the model. The model
#' object is used as input by classes that perform operations on the model such
#' as evaluation of model performance, text predictions and comparision of model
#' performance.
