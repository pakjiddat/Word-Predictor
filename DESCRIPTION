Description: The wordpredictor package allows developing n-gram models for text
    prediction. It provides methods for data cleaning, data sampling,
    tokenization, model generation, model evaluation and word prediction.
    For information on how n-gram models work we referred to: Jurafsky, Daniel &
    Martin, James. (2008). "Speech and Language Processing: An Introduction to
    Natural Language Processing, Computational Linguistics, and Speech
    Recognition" <https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/3.pdf>.
    For optimizing R code and using R6 classes we reffered to Hadley Wickham,
    "Advanced R" <https://adv-r.hadley.nz/r6.html>. For writing R extensions we
    refer to Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan, "R Packages",
    <https://r-pkgs.org/index.html>.
