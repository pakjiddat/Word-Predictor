Description: It allows developing n-gram models for predicting text. It allows 
    cleaning input text using various options such as removal of stop words, 
    profanity, non-dictionary words, punctuation, stop words and stemming. 
    It generates n-gram tokens of a given size from a text file. It also 
    generates transition probability data for the n-grams. This data is used 
    to predict the next word given a set of words. The model's performance can 
    be evaluation using Perplexity (intrinsic evaluation) and 
    accuracy (extrinsic evaluation). The package also provides methods for 
    analyzing the n-gram model using bar plots. For example it displays plots 
    of n-gram frequencies and plots of model performance. It provides methods 
    for generating the n-gram model step by step or by using a single method. 
    The performance of the generated model may be evaluated and displayed in 
    plots. The generated model can be easily exported as a R object and used 
    in applications. The package is implemented using R6 classes.
